# Changelog

## 1.5.5 - 2026-09-22

### English

#### New features

- Cloud backup to your own server. Settings → Maintenance gains a cloud-backup page supporting WebDAV: pick the data domains to back up (todo, quick capture, widget style), set the interval and retention count, and store the password in Windows Credential Manager. "Test connection" validates the credentials you just typed, backups can run on demand, and remote snapshots are listed for browsing and restoring.
- Scoped restore. Pick which data domains come back and choose merge — newer entries win, nothing on this device is deleted — or a full snapshot-faithful restore. The confirmation dialog shows per-domain item counts; restores stage and validate first, then apply on the next launch with a pre-restore safety archive pinned.
- Hotkeys now self-heal. Windows can silently strip low-level hooks under memory pressure or timeouts, leaving the global hotkey, search hotkey, or desktop double-click activation dead until restart. A health watchdog now detects this and re-registers the hook automatically.
- New "Trim memory when idle" performance option returns memory after a few seconds of true quiet, not only when everything is hidden — guarded by working-set floors and ambient-animation awareness.
- New window-shadow toggle in Appearance settings, applied system-wide with write-back verification and searchable in settings.
- Storage-root migration is now interactive: a progress dialog you can cancel, with per-file retry / skip / apply-to-all when something fails, and skipped files can be migrated later.
- Compact widgets can override the expansion direction per widget (auto / down / up) from the collapse menu, and capsule bars can be reordered by dragging — including across monitors.

#### Drag and drop

- Drags out of widgets now carry the same native Shell data object Explorer uses. Copy-only drop targets that used to reject DeskBox drags — Chromium/Electron apps such as VS Code and browsers, WM_DROPFILES-era programs, and WinForms — now accept them. Same-volume drops default to move, cross-volume to copy, and Ctrl/Shift/Alt modifiers behave as expected on Windows 11; Windows 10 keeps the single-move behavior without prompting.
- Cross-volume transfers now go through the system file-operation engine with native progress, cancellation, and conflict dialogs, fixing the cross-volume import that completed with "0 items" on Native AOT builds. Same-volume moves keep the existing fast path.
- Aborted transfers clean up only the objects the operation itself created, so files that appeared in the destination mid-copy or pre-existing folders are never swept away; transfer errors now distinguish "file in use" from "access denied".

#### Interface

- Snap alignment feedback while resizing or dragging widgets is now a crisp accent edge band that settles once — the old looping breathing glow is gone, and the band dissolves cleanly around rounded corners.
- New widget groups now default to the tab navigation style.
- A one-time hint now explains when Mica/Acrylic materials fall back to a solid color because Windows transparency effects or battery saver turned them off — including the moment they are switched off mid-session.
- The settings window no longer freezes on the theme it had when it was closed: after being closed (hidden) and reopened it follows the system light/dark switch again.
- The in-app feedback dialog no longer gets stuck on "Submitting…" after a network timeout, keeps error text visible after a success, and disables the submit button properly while rate-limited; a "send another" button follows a successful submission.
- Widget folder-conflict messages now say exactly how two folders conflict (identical, nested inside, or containing) and name the other widget with its full path.

#### Performance and memory

- Idle z-order normalization now reorders widgets as a peer group instead of flattening them to the desktop bottom, reducing visible reordering flicker.
- Memory cleanup is better coordinated: immediate-hidden and idle trims no longer race each other.
- Entering a widget with a foreign drag skips a cross-process format query that could never succeed, so drag-over feels snappier.

#### Fixes

- Native AOT builds: the cloud-backup page no longer crashes with "Specified cast is not valid" when reading the password box (real WebDAV user report).
- Shortcut icons: shortcuts created by alt-dragging keep the target's own icon instead of DeskBox's, and arrow-overlaid shortcut icons render through a high-resolution compositing channel instead of pre-scaled 32/48 px bitmaps — blurry shortcut arrows at large sizes are fixed.
- Creating or renaming a widget is no longer blocked by a folder left behind by a closed same-named widget: the empty widget adopts the leftover folder and its contents.
- Migration rollback failures are no longer silent: a dedicated dialog lists the stranded folders with their widget names and offers retry, and partial cleanups keep their remaining list instead of claiming success.
- The migration dialog no longer loops forever when "apply to all" meets a locked file, and no longer waits forever for a decision after the dialog has been closed.
- Files without an association open through DeskBox's own picker, which reports honestly — the shell picker reported success even when it was cancelled — and a "recommended" handler is no longer mistaken for the default association.
- Cloud backups no longer include todo and quick-capture attachments (a single large attachment used to inflate the whole upload), and restores never delete local attachments.
- Merge restores no longer resurrect entries you deleted on this device: quick capture and todo deletions now leave tombstones that keep cloud snapshots from bringing them back.
- A backup the server accepted but never listed is no longer mistaken for a plain success or a failure — it is stamped "awaiting server confirmation" in the backup status and notified once, so a laggy WebDAV listing cannot hide a silently-dropped snapshot.
- Restored todo widgets adopt their orphaned on-disk store instead of starting empty, and manual widget ordering survives restore and rearrange flows more reliably.
- Restore packages are now validated against the bytes actually extracted — per-file and total caps enforced on the real stream — instead of trusting sizes declared inside the archive.

#### Reliability and upgrades

- The device-local widget layout moved into its own widget-layout.json file: it is adopted from settings.json on the first launch after updating, corrupt files are quarantined with .bak recovery instead of being treated as empty, and it stays out of cloud backups so restoring styles on another device never overwrites this device's layout.
- Layout files that parse but are not layout documents (an empty object or a null layout) are treated as corrupt instead of wiping the desktop.
- Layout and settings are now committed as a pair with rollback — a crash mid-save can no longer leave the two files describing different states. Widget-style restore became a journaled two-phase commit with crash recovery, and layout files written by a newer schema version fail honestly instead of pretending to save.
- Backup snapshots and settings saves share a write gate, so a backup can no longer capture a torn half-saved pair; pre-restore safety archives are pinned to their pending restore so retries don't stack or evict them, and pending-restore markers retry only a bounded number of times.
- Folder adoption resolves junctions and symbolic links before checking ownership, so aliased directories cannot bypass the takeover guards.

### 中文

#### 新功能

- 云备份上线：设置 → 维护新增云备份页，支持 WebDAV。可选要备份的数据域（待办、快采、格子样式），自定义备份频率与保留份数，密码保存在 Windows 凭据管理器中。"测试连接"会直接校验刚输入的凭据，支持立即备份，并可浏览远端快照清单进行还原。
- 域作用域还原：可选回哪些数据域，并选择"合并"（新者胜出、不删除本机数据）或"完全恢复"（严格按快照还原）。确认对话框会显示每个域的条目数；还原先暂存校验，下次启动时安全应用，且先固定一份还原前安全归档。
- 热键自愈。Windows 在内存压力或超时下会静默摘除低级钩子，让全局热键、搜索热键或桌面双击激活一直失灵到重启为止。现在有健康 watchdog 自动检测并重新注册钩子。
- 新增"空闲时修剪内存"性能选项：格子真正静默几秒后即可向系统归还内存，不再要求全部隐藏——带工作集下限与常驻动画感知保护。
- 外观设置新增窗口阴影开关：系统级写入并读回校验，可在设置中搜索到。
- 收纳根迁移改为交互式：带进度的对话框、可取消，单文件失败可逐项选择重试/跳过/应用到全部，跳过的文件事后可补迁移。
- 紧凑格子可在收起菜单中单独覆盖展开方向（自动/向下/向上），胶囊条支持拖拽重排——包括跨显示器。

#### 拖拽

- 从格子拖出文件现在携带与 Explorer 同源的原生 Shell 数据对象。此前拒绝 DeskBox 拖放的仅复制型目标——VS Code、浏览器等 Chromium/Electron 应用、WM_DROPFILES 时代的老程序、WinForms——现在都能接受。同盘默认移动、跨盘默认复制，Win11 上 Ctrl/Shift/Alt 修饰键符合预期；Win10 保持单一移动语义、不再弹选择框。
- 跨盘传输改走系统文件操作引擎，获得原生进度、取消与冲突对话框——修复了 Native AOT 版跨盘导入以"0 items"空完成的问题。同盘移动保留原有快速路径。
- 中止的传输只清理本次操作自己创建的对象——复制中途外部丢进目标树的文件、操作前就存在的文件夹不会被误删；传输报错区分"文件被占用"与"拒绝访问"。

#### 界面

- 调整或拖动格子时的对齐吸附反馈改为锐利的 accent 边缘光带，落定一次后稳定常亮——移除了旧的循环呼吸辉光，光带在圆角处自然消融。
- 新建格子组默认使用标签页导航样式。
- 当 Windows 透明效果或省电模式导致 Mica/亚克力材质降级为实色时，会给出一次性提示说明原因——包括会话中途被关掉的瞬间。
- 设置窗口不再冻结在关闭时的主题：关闭（实为隐藏）再重新打开后，恢复跟随系统明暗切换。
- 应用内反馈弹窗不再在网络超时后卡在"提交中…"，错误提示在成功提交后仍可见，限流期间正确禁用提交按钮；提交成功后新增"再提交一条"按钮。
- 格子文件夹冲突提示现在说清两个文件夹如何冲突（相同/包含于/包含对方），并显示对方格子名称与完整路径。

#### 性能与内存

- 空闲 Z 序归一化改为按同级窗口组重排，不再一股脑压到桌面底层，减少可见的重排闪烁。
- 内存清理协调性更好：隐藏立即修剪与静默修剪不再相互竞争。
- 外来拖入格子时跳过一次注定失败的跨进程格式查询，拖拽悬停响应更干脆。

#### 修复

- Native AOT 版：云备份页读取密码框不再崩溃（"Specified cast is not valid"，来自真实 WebDAV 用户反馈）。
- 快捷方式图标：Alt 拖拽创建的快捷方式保留目标自身的图标而不再错误使用 DeskBox 图标；带箭头的快捷方式图标改走高分辨率合成通道，不再是预缩放的 32/48px 位图——大尺寸下快捷方式箭头模糊的问题已修复。
- 新建或重命名格子不再被已关闭的同名格子残留的文件夹堵死：空格子会接管残留文件夹及其内容。
- 迁移回滚失败不再静默：专用对话框列出搁浅文件夹及其所属格子并提供重试；部分清理会保留剩余清单，不再谎报成功。
- 迁移对话框不再在"应用到全部"遇到被锁文件时无限循环，也不再在对话框关闭后永久等待用户决定。
- 无关联文件改用 DeskBox 自有的打开方式选择器并如实报告结果（系统选择器被取消也会伪装成成功），且不再把"推荐处理器"误判为默认关联。
- 云备份不再包含待办与快采的附件（单个大附件原先会撑大整包上传），还原也不会删除本机附件。
- 合并还原不再复活本机已删除的条目：快采和待办的删除现在会留下墓碑，云快照不会再把它们带回来。
- 服务器已接收但迟迟未列入目录的备份不再被误当作普通成功或失败——备份状态会标注"等待服务器确认"并通知一次，列表延迟的 WebDAV 无法掩盖悄悄丢失的快照。
- 还原的待办格子会收编磁盘上的孤儿数据存储，不再从空白开始；手动排序在还原和重排流程中更可靠地保留。
- 还原包校验改为按实际解出的字节数执行——单文件与总量上限作用于真实数据流——不再采信归档内部声明的大小。

#### 可靠性与升级

- 设备本地格子布局拆分为独立的 widget-layout.json：升级后首次启动自动从 settings.json 收养；损坏文件会被隔离取证并回退 .bak，不再被当作空布局；且不进云备份域——在另一台设备还原样式不会覆盖本机布局。
- 能解析但不是布局文档的文件（空对象或 null 布局）按损坏处理，不再清空桌面。
- 布局与设置成对提交、任一失败即回滚——保存中途崩溃不再留下两个文件指向不同状态的半提交对。格子样式还原改为日志化两段提交并支持崩溃恢复；更新版本写入的布局文件会如实保存失败，不再假报成功。
- 备份快照与设置保存共用写入门，备份不再拍到撕裂的半保存对；还原前安全归档固定到其待还原事务，重试不会叠加或挤掉它；待还原标记的重试次数有上限。
- 文件夹接管前先解析 junction 与符号链接，别名目录无法绕过接管守卫。

## 1.5.4 - 2026-09-18

### English

#### Fixes

- Fix memory climbing and staying high after large batch operations in file widgets (importing, organizing, or cutting thousands of files could leave private memory near 1 GB with no recovery until restart). Settings persistence now streams to disk instead of materializing multi-megabyte buffers, and move-out batches no longer trigger thousands of redundant saves.
- Stop the visible freeze when cutting a large selection out of a widget: the cut-state sweep now runs once per batch instead of once per collection event.
- Bound the undo history retained inside settings.json. Batches beyond the receipt limits keep their history entry as a summary (real item count, no partial undo), so settings.json can no longer grow unboundedly after repeated large operations; existing bloated profiles shrink automatically on the first launch after updating.
- Speed up large widget operations by replacing per-file list scans with a scoped path index and binary insertion during imports and watcher reloads.

### 中文

#### 修复

- 修复文件格子大批量操作（导入、整理、剪切数千文件）后内存攀升且高居不下、需重启才能恢复的问题。设置持久化改为流式写盘，不再生成数 MB 的临时缓冲；移出批处理不再触发数千次冗余保存。
- 修复从格子剪切大量文件时的可见卡顿：剪切状态清扫从每个集合事件一次合并为每批一次。
- 为 settings.json 中的撤销历史设置上限。超出限额的批次保留为摘要条目（真实数量、不做部分撤销），settings.json 不再因反复大批量操作无限膨胀；已膨胀的配置在升级后首次启动时自动瘦身。
- 导入与监视器重载期间用批内路径索引和二分插入替代逐文件列表扫描，大批量操作更快。

## 1.5.3 - 2026-09-16

### English

#### New features

- Add standard startup and an optional scheduled-task method to direct installations. New users default to standard startup; existing installations keep their active method. Failed task registration can fall back to verified standard startup, failed switches preserve the previous entry, and Windows disable choices are respected.

#### Fixes

- Read scheduled-task definitions and rollback snapshots directly as Unicode so non-ASCII account names and installation paths pass registration verification.
- Register notifications before decoding activation arguments, preventing the uninitialized notification-deserializer path during notification launches. Queue early notification input until the main instance is ready, and keep ordinary startup available when notifications are unsupported or cannot register.
- Retry tray creation while the desktop shell starts and terminate fatal initialization failures instead of leaving a headless process holding the instance lock. Extend the watchdog to constructor initialization.
- Retry failed first-time autostart registration on a later launch without consuming the one-time default marker.
- Preserve boolean verification results in diagnostic exports while continuing to hide actual paths and account identifiers.

### 中文

#### 新功能

- 为直装版增加标准自启和可选计划任务。新用户默认标准方式，已有安装保留实际生效的方式；任务注册失败时可回退到验证成功的标准自启，切换失败保留旧入口，并尊重 Windows 禁用选择。

#### 修复

- 直接按 Unicode 读取计划任务定义和回滚快照，避免非 ASCII 账户名及安装路径在注册校验时被读错。
- 先注册通知再解码激活参数，修复通知拉起应用时进入未初始化反序列化路径的问题；初始化期间的通知先排队，等主实例就绪后处理，通知不受支持或注册失败时仍保留普通启动。
- 在桌面外壳启动期间重试托盘创建，不可恢复的初始化失败会退出，避免留下占用实例锁的无界面进程；看门狗同时覆盖构造阶段。
- 首次自动开启自启失败后允许后续启动重试，不再提前消耗一次性默认标记。
- 在诊断导出中保留布尔校验结果，同时继续隐藏实际路径和账户标识。

## 1.5.2 - 2026-09-15

### English

#### Fixes

- File widgets no longer cap their contents at the first 30 items. Folders up to the render threshold show every item again, and larger folders extend the rendered window whenever the visible area is not yet filled (1.5.1 could leave tall widgets stuck at 30 items with no way to reach the rest — reported through the in-app feedback channel).

### 中文

#### 修复

- 修复文件格子最多只显示前 30 个项目的问题。不高于渲染阈值的文件夹恢复显示全部条目，更大的文件夹在可视区域尚未填满时自动扩展渲染窗口（1.5.1 中较高的格子可能停在 30 项且无法查看其余内容——经应用内反馈渠道报告）。

## 1.5.1 - 2026-09-15

### English

#### New features

- Dropping files onto an application shortcut tile now opens them with that application, both for drops from the desktop and drags between widgets; non-executable or unverifiable targets keep the default system behavior.
- Hovering a file you are dragging over a widget-group tab for a short dwell now switches to that member, so multi-widget groups can be reached without dropping the file first.
- Added a sixth global hotkey preset for the hardware Copilot key (delivered as Win+Shift+F23 by most keyboards), including the show-desktop special case.
- In click-collapse mode, clicking a widget's title bar now collapses it directly; the identity area keeps its double-click meaning through a short delayed window.
- The search popup gains Images and Documents result tabs; switching tabs scrolls back to the top, and the category filter resets for each new query.
- Added an in-app feedback entry point in Settings that opens the feedback dialog with diagnostics context (delivery depends on the feedback service backend).
- Direct-install autostart now registers a least-privilege logon task as the single startup entry; the legacy Run key is treated only as a migration source, and a task disabled by the user is never bypassed.

#### Fixes

- Changing the default storage location no longer fails when a widget folder contains read-only files (a common trait of files received over chat apps, cloud drives, or attachment bundles): source cleanup now clears the read-only attribute before deleting and restores it if the delete is blocked.
- Source cleanup only deletes files that were verifiably copied and unchanged; a file that appears or changes inside the folder during the move is kept in both places instead of being deleted.
- When the old folder cannot be cleaned up after a complete copy, the migration finishes and offers to move the leftover folders to the recycle bin instead of failing and rolling back; retrying into a folder that still holds a previous attempt's copy offers to clear it first instead of creating "name (2)" duplicates. Dropping folders into widgets, organizing desktop files, and moving a deleted widget's contents back to the desktop share the same fixes.
- The recommended-apps grid in the search popup now responds to the mouse: single-click selects, double-click opens, and arrow keys plus Enter launch the highlighted card (mouse handling had silently never worked since the grid was introduced), and icons now resolve on the very first open instead of appearing only after reopening the popup.
- Opening a file with no shell association now raises the system Open With picker instead of appearing dead, success toasts for opens were removed, and the selection ghost after clicking an item is suppressed.
- Opening a shortcut whose stored target is gone now reports the lost target instead of claiming the request was handed to Windows.
- Dropping hidden or otherwise undisplayable shortcuts no longer swallows them silently — the drop is rejected as a whole with feedback, so files never land in the folder without a tile.
- Renaming a widget no longer leaves an empty tile when the on-disk rename lands inside the one-second save debounce window.
- Capsule transitions are fully repaired: collapsing a widget no longer leaves a residual 4-DIP upward offset on the title bar of the next expansion, and the first expansion after a fresh launch no longer leaves capsule icon and title ghosts floating over the expanded body (both were Composition properties left at their last animation frame or aborted mid-completion).
- Clicking an item in the native Windows context menu no longer stalls the whole system for one to two seconds: the low-level mouse hook moved off the UI thread onto a dedicated pump thread and unloads as soon as the menu closes.
- Associated icons whose artwork sits inside a larger transparent canvas no longer shrink inside file tiles; the significant-alpha boundary check re-issues the icon at its native frame size.
- Organize Desktop recovery is hardened: abandoning an unrecoverable restore has an explicit confirmation and diagnostics path, orphaned recovery journals are cleared, same-volume frees are exempt from the space check, failure messages are specific, and widget-mapping conflicts auto-resolve or reveal the conflicting tiles instead of failing silently.
- The recycle-bin third-level confirmation can no longer fail to appear in Smart mode because of a missing lease, and deleting a widget whose managed folder is empty now removes the empty folder outright.
- Search, notes, and other popup windows opened during a quick-reveal (tray or hotkey) session no longer sink below the raised widget layer while it stays on top.
- Switching the active member of a stack no longer flashes the previous member's tiles; the popover clears and refills its containers on switch.
- Search-row selection indicators align with the text center, and row heights are cached with a highlight retry after lazy metadata loads.
- Widget-local failure dialogs (delete and rename failures, the color picker) became in-widget feedback bars and flyouts instead of ContentDialogs that small widget windows clipped.
- Orphaned todo widget data is cleaned up, and cache directories are excluded from automatic backups.

#### Performance and memory

- File widgets now render a windowed slice of very large folders and hydrate more rows as you scroll, so opening a folder with thousands of files no longer freezes the interface.
- First launch after a fresh install is faster: shell icon extraction runs as one batched request through the thumbnail proxy instead of per-item broker round trips.
- New installations now default to the Resource saver performance preset: visible-idle maintenance after 5 minutes, hidden cache release after 30 seconds with full recreatable-cache scope, and the small cache budget. The experimental immediate hidden working-set trim waits 3 seconds after hiding, and quick hide/show round trips trim at most once. Existing settings are never rewritten on upgrade.
- Marquee selection applies incrementally instead of clearing and refilling the list, display-topology changes (plug, unplug, resolution) are event-driven instead of a two-second poll, and the retired smart animation adapter stack plus throttled text-shadow reconciliation remove idle animation overhead.
- Capsule expansion animations only animate the properties the transition actually changes, and window bounds commits during animations are batched, removing start/stop cost from opening frames.

#### Interface

- Interaction chrome — the group drop-preview outline, capsule position-rail dots, and title wheel feedback — now draws the neutral interaction tone instead of the accent color and re-resolves correctly on light/dark flips.
- Corner radii across tiles, search rows, note cards, and todo rows converge to a tighter scale, and the immediate-trim setting documents its 3-second grace window in all 12 languages.

### 中文

#### 新功能

- 拖放文件到应用快捷方式格子上，现在会用该应用打开文件；桌面拖入与格间互拖均支持，非可执行或无法验证的目标仍按系统默认行为处理。
- 拖动文件时在分组标签上悬停片刻即切换到对应格子，多格组内拖拽不再需要先放下文件。
- 新增第 6 个全局热键预设：Copilot 实体键（多数键盘以 Win+Shift+F23 上报），并处理了系统显示桌面的特判。
- 点击收起模式下，点击格子标题栏即直接收起；身份区通过短暂的延迟双击窗口保留原有双击语义。
- 搜索弹窗新增图片与文档结果 Tab；切换 Tab 滚动回到顶部，分类筛选随新查询自动重置。
- 设置中新增应用内一键反馈入口，带诊断上下文打开反馈弹窗（实际送达依赖反馈服务后端）。
- 直装版自启动改为注册最小权限登录任务作为唯一启动入口；旧 Run 键仅作为迁移来源，用户禁用的任务不会被绕过。

#### 修复

- 修改默认收纳路径不再因格子文件夹里有只读文件而失败（聊天工具、网盘、附件包收到的文件常带只读属性）：清理源目录前会先清除只读属性，删除受阻时恢复原属性。
- 源目录清理只删除已确认复制且未发生变化的文件；搬移期间在文件夹里新出现或被修改的文件会在两边同时保留，绝不会被误删。
- 复制完成后旧文件夹清不掉时，迁移正常完成并提供把残留文件夹移入回收站的选项，而不是判为失败并回滚；重试的目标里还有上次留下的副本时，会先提示清理而不是复制出一堆「名称 (2)」。拖文件夹进格子、整理桌面文件、删除格子时把内容移回桌面走同一套修复。
- 搜索弹窗推荐区的应用图标现在响应鼠标：单击选中、双击打开、方向键加 Enter 启动高亮卡片（该区域自上线以来鼠标操作一直静默无效），并且图标在首次打开时即可解析显示，不再需要第二次打开。
- 双击无文件关联的文件现在弹出系统「打开方式」选择器而不是毫无反应；打开成功的 toast 提示已移除，点击后的选中残留也被抑制。
- 打开目标已丢失的快捷方式现在明确提示目标丢失，不再谎报"已交给系统打开"。
- 拖入隐藏属性或无法显示的快捷方式不再被静默吞掉——整笔拒绝并给出反馈，文件不会进目录后凭空没有格子。
- 重命名格子不再因磁盘改名落在一秒保存防抖窗口内而留下空格子。
- 胶囊过渡彻底修复：收起格子后再次展开，标题栏不再残留 4 DIP 的上移偏移；全新安装后首次展开胶囊，展开区域中间不再残留胶囊图标与标题（两者分别是合成动画属性停在最后一帧、以及完成链被异常中断所致）。
- 点击 Windows 原生右键菜单项不再令整机卡顿 1-2 秒：底层鼠标钩子从 UI 线程移到专职泵线程，菜单关闭即卸载。
- 关联图标画布带大透明边距时不再在文件格子内缩水；显著 alpha 边界检测会按原始帧尺寸重新取图。
- 整理桌面恢复强化：不可恢复的放弃有明确确认与诊断出口、孤儿恢复日志被清理、同卷释放豁免空间检查、报错信息具体化、格子映射冲突自动解决或揭示冲突格子，不再静默失败。
- 回收站第三级确认不再因缺少租约而在 Smart 模式下弹不出；删除管理文件夹已空的格子时直接删除空文件夹。
- 快捷唤起（托盘或热键）期间打开的搜索、随记等弹窗不再沉到置顶的格子层下面。
- 切换叠放活动成员不再闪现前一成员的瓦片；弹层在切换时清空并重填容器。
- 搜索行选中指示条与文字中心对齐；行高缓存并在懒加载元数据后重试高亮。
- 格子内的失败弹窗（删除、重命名失败与取色器）改为应用内反馈条与 Flyout，不再被小窗口裁剪。
- 清理孤儿待办数据，自动备份不再包含缓存目录。

#### 性能与内存

- 文件格子对超大文件夹改为窗口化渲染，滚动时按需水合更多行，打开上千文件的文件夹不再卡死界面。
- 全新安装后的首次启动更快：Shell 图标提取改为通过缩略图代理单次批量请求，不再逐项往返。
- 全新安装的默认性能预设改为「节省资源」：可见空闲维护 5 分钟、隐藏后 30 秒释放全部可重建缓存、较小缓存预算。实验性的「隐藏后立即裁剪工作集」改为隐藏 3 秒后执行，连续隐藏/显示最多裁剪一次。升级安装绝不改写既有设置。
- 框选改为增量应用不再清空重填；显示器拓扑变化（插拔、分辨率）改为事件驱动不再 2 秒轮询；退役智能动画适配栈并节流文本阴影对账，消除空闲动画开销。
- 胶囊展开动画只动画该过渡实际变化的属性，动画期间的窗口边界提交改为批量合并，消除起始帧的启停开销。

#### 界面

- 交互元素——组拖放预览描边、胶囊位置指示点、标题滚轮反馈——改用中性交互色，不再跟随强调色，亮暗主题切换即时正确刷新。
- 瓦片、搜索行、随记卡片与待办条目的圆角收敛到更紧凑的档位；「隐藏后立即裁剪」设置在全部 12 种语言中说明了 3 秒宽限窗口。

## 1.5.0 - 2026-09-06

### English

#### New features

- Added automatic data snapshots with a configurable schedule: enable or disable backups (on by default), choose the interval from every 5 minutes to every 5 days (daily by default), keep between 3 and 30 snapshots (7 by default), and optionally store them in a custom directory. Invalid values hand-edited into the configuration file are normalized to the nearest preset, and a custom directory that becomes unavailable falls back to the default recovery folder with a single notification per degradation cycle.
- Redesigned Organize Desktop around a desktop preview card: tile selection is expressed through clear selected/unselected opacity, re-scanning keeps your previous selections (newly appearing files start unchecked), and the entry action is now "Preview organize". The source picker can optionally include the shared Public Desktop; moving its files may request administrator approval, a canceled approval keeps the completed personal-desktop work, and interrupted operations can be resumed or recovered at the next startup.
- Folder shortcuts (`.lnk`) that point inside the widget's own managed tree now open the folder inside the file widget instead of File Explorer; external, broken, or unverifiable shortcuts keep the default system behavior.
- Quick Capture and Todo each gained independent list and content text-size sliders in Settings; when left unset they keep following the global appearance text size.
- Added a Glance clock time-format setting: follow system (default, without AM/PM markers), 24-hour, or 12-hour.
- Added an optional setting to show the native Windows context menu when right-clicking a single file tile (off by default); stacks and multi-selection keep the built-in menu.
- File, folder, and `desktop.ini` custom icons are now fetched as 256-px high-resolution Shell icons with shortcut overlays preserved, and internet shortcuts (`.url`) resolve their icons through the Shell, so covers and per-user associations (for example Steam) display correctly.
- Added an experimental performance setting that trims the working set immediately after all widgets finish their hide animation (pairs with "Compress memory when idle").

#### Fixes

- Stabilized internal drag completion: a pointer release no longer rebuilds the file list before the Shell drop completes, and entering a drop revokes any provisional Move acceptance, so internal reorders can no longer trigger Shell shortcut cleanup.
- Inline rename fields now reliably receive keyboard focus across every entry point (group title, file item, stack popover, Quick Capture item), and a popup stealing focus within 300 ms is reclaimed instead of treated as a commit.
- Steam shortcuts are no longer treated as uninstalled when the Steam library sits on an unavailable removable or network drive; the probe reports "unknown" and keeps the item visible.
- Dropping files into the directory they already occupy — including junction- and symlink-resolved paths, the grid root, and stack popovers — is rejected up front with clear feedback instead of performing a duplicate transfer.
- Recursive folder copies now detect junction and symbolic-link cycles, and moving a folder into itself (including through a link) is refused.
- Shortcut health checks no longer mark network-share roots or environment-variable targets as broken; only a locally missing target is reported.
- Opening a file no longer leaves press or hover highlight on the item, and returning to the parent folder no longer reselects the folder you just exited.
- File icons refresh correctly after a file is moved out and back into a managed path, because watcher events now clear every cached icon variant, including failed lookups.
- File-widget mapping validation rejects paths that overlap the managed storage root or another widget's mapped directory.
- Settings and data files save more robustly: when atomic replacement fails, a verified in-place write is used, and a corrupt primary file can be recovered from the automatic backup.
- Group-tab drag reordering rolls back to the previous order when saving fails, and no longer writes when nothing changed.
- The in-app updater's official-download action opens the website instead of a mirror direct link, and update notes render as plain text.
- Fixed visual residue that could remain after a widget finished its compact-transition animation.
- Dragging files into a grid across volumes now posts Shell change notifications (per-item rename plus a forced directory refresh), so Explorer views — including OneDrive-backed desktops — no longer keep stale icons of moved files until a manual refresh.
- Quick Capture and Todo compact capsules show a static, ellipsized preview instead of a scrolling marquee, which previously displayed only a truncated fragment of long content.

#### Performance and memory

- Settings sections are now created on demand when first navigated to, so the Settings window opens faster and keeps a smaller resident tree; the settings search index is generated from localization keys, so search finds settings in sections that have not been created yet.
- Thumbnail and icon proxy payloads are read directly into their final buffer without growth-buffer copies.
- File items instantiate only the active layout (icon or list) instead of both, and widget title icons load their geometry lazily.
- High-resolution Shell icon requests are throttled through a bounded queue, keeping the icon proxy responsive while many icons load at once.

#### Interface

- Widget title bars are more compact (40-px minimum row with tightened padding).
- Group tabs use a native TabView appearance with a translucent selected background and content-sized labels.
- The Settings update section was rebuilt as a detail flow with clearer progress and action layout.

### 中文

#### 新功能

- 新增数据自动快照备份：可开关（默认开启）、可选备份间隔（5 分钟到 5 天共 6 档，默认每天）、保留份数（3~30 份，默认 7 份），并支持自定义备份目录。手工编辑配置文件写出的非法值会自动归一化到最接近的预设；自定义目录不可用时自动降级到默认恢复目录，并在每轮降级中只提醒一次。
- 整理桌面围绕桌面预览卡重新设计：瓦片选中状态用明确的透明度区分，重新扫描会保留之前的选择（新出现的文件默认不勾选），入口动作改为「预览整理」。来源选择可选择纳入公共桌面；移动公共桌面文件可能弹出管理员授权，取消授权时个人桌面已完成的部分保留，被中断的操作可继续恢复，下次启动也会提示处理挂起的恢复。
- 指向格子自身收纳目录内的文件夹快捷方式（`.lnk`）现在直接在文件格子内展开，不再跳转资源管理器；指向外部、损坏或无法验证目标的快捷方式仍按系统默认方式打开。
- 快捷捕捉和待办各自新增「列表文字大小」「内容文字大小」滑杆设置；未设置时继续跟随全局外观字号。
- 时光时钟新增时间格式设置：跟随系统（默认，不带上午/下午标记）、24 小时制或 12 小时制。
- 新增可选设置：右键单个文件格子时弹出 Windows 原生菜单（默认关闭）；叠放与多选仍使用内置菜单。
- 文件、文件夹及 `desktop.ini` 自定义图标改用 256px 高分辨率 Shell 图标，快捷方式小箭头等叠加层保持正确；网址快捷方式（`.url`）图标改由 Shell 解析，Steam 封面和按用户关联的图标可正确显示。
- 新增实验性性能设置：全部格子隐藏动画结束后立即裁剪工作集（需与「空闲时压缩内存占用」配合使用）。

#### 修复

- 稳定内部拖拽的完成顺序：鼠标释放不再在系统 Drop 完成前重建文件列表，进入放置时会先撤销临时接受的移动操作，内部排序不会再触发 Shell 对快捷方式的清理。
- 内联重命名框在所有入口（小组标题、文件项、叠放弹窗、快捷捕捉条目）都能可靠获得键盘焦点；打开后 300 毫秒内被弹窗抢走的焦点会自动夺回，不再被误判为提交。
- Steam 库位于不可用的可移动盘或网络盘时，Steam 快捷方式不再被判定为「已卸载」而隐藏；探测结果归为「未知」并保留条目。
- 把文件放到它已经所在的目录——包括经过 junction/符号链接解析的路径、格子根目录和叠放弹窗——会提前拒绝并给出明确反馈，不再执行无意义的重复传输。
- 递归复制文件夹时检测 junction 与符号链接循环；把文件夹移动进自身（含经链接）会被拒绝。
- 快捷方式健康检查不再把网络共享根目录或含环境变量的目标误标为损坏；只有本地目标确实缺失才报告。
- 打开文件后不再残留按压或悬停高亮；返回上级文件夹不再重新选中刚退出的文件夹。
- 文件移出又移回收纳路径后图标正确刷新：目录监视事件现在清除全部图标缓存变体，包括失败的记录。
- 文件格子的路径校验会拒绝与收纳存储根或其他格子映射目录重叠的路径。
- 设置与数据文件保存更健壮：原子替换失败时改用经过验证的就地写入；主文件损坏时可从自动备份恢复。
- 小组标签拖拽排序在保存失败时回滚到原顺序，顺序没有变化时不再写设置。
- 应用内更新的「官方下载」改为跳转官网而非云盘直链，更新说明以纯文本呈现。
- 修复格子完成收纳（压缩）过渡动画后可能残留的视觉残影。
- 跨盘把文件拖入格子后，资源管理器视图（包括 OneDrive 同步的桌面）不再残留已移走文件的图标：托管移动现在补发 Shell 变更通知（逐项改名加强制目录刷新），无需手动刷新。
- 快捷捕捉与待办的胶囊改为静态省略号预览，不再滚动长文本——此前跑马灯只能显示被截断的片段。

#### 性能与内存

- 设置分区改为导航到时才创建，设置窗口打开更快、常驻界面树更小；设置搜索索引由本地化键生成，未创建的分区里的设置项也能被搜到。
- 缩略图与图标代理的载荷直接读入最终缓冲区，去除增长缓冲的整块拷贝。
- 文件项只实例化当前使用的布局（图标或列表二者其一），小组件标题图标按需加载几何。
- 高分辨率 Shell 图标请求经有界队列限流，大量图标同时加载时代理仍保持响应。

#### 界面

- 小组件标题栏更紧凑（最小行高 40，内边距收紧）。
- 小组标签改用原生 TabView 外观，选中背景半透明、标签宽度按内容自适应。
- 设置的更新分区重构为详情流，进度与操作按钮排版更清晰。

## 1.4.9 - 2026-09-01

### English

- Fixed unbounded memory growth from repeatedly opening and closing the Settings window: each cycle used to leak a full native XAML tree (~10 MB) due to a known WinUI 3 window-close defect. The settings window is now reused — closing hides it and the same instance is reshown, with state refreshed on reopen.
- The idle deep memory collection no longer gives up when vetoed by its 120-second cooldown: it retries with backoff until the finalizer collection actually runs.
- Switching widget materials no longer destroys and recreates system backdrop controllers (their kind is mutable), eliminating per-switch native handle accumulation; DWM theme attributes are only re-issued when the theme actually changes.
- Restored the pre-1.4.5 idle memory compression behind a new setting, "Compress memory when idle" (on by default, in Performance settings): after the hidden-idle deep cleanup completes, the working set is paged out (e.g. 350 MB down to under 10 MB); while widgets are visible it only runs when the user is fully away and the footprint exceeds the original bloat thresholds.
- Hardened file-open interactions: opening is gated and traced, runs on a bounded STA runner, and file items get opening animations and text scaling.
- Renaming a file to a different extension now asks for confirmation using the Windows extension-change warning; the stack popover supports in-place rename.
- Stabilized the complete file drag protocol across Windows 10 and Windows 11: normal left-button drag-out no longer opens an operation chooser, internal sorting and stack membership never authorize Shell source deletion, and files can again move between the surface and stacks in both inline and popover modes. Session-scoped payload caching and guarded pointer-release recovery prevent stale targets and insertion lines that do not commit.
- File-widget empty states now follow the underlying source collection, so importing the first item hides the empty view immediately and moving out the final item restores it immediately.
- Full Native AOT Direct packages now include and architecture-audit the restore-locked Windows App Runtime Insights resource required by Windows 10 notification initialization.
- Startup registration was refactored into direct and store services with contract tests.
- Release validation: x64 test suite 3118/3118 passed; Debug and Release Native AOT builds verified (Release AOT steady state: ~115 MB private / ~171 MB working set).

### 中文

- 修复反复打开/关闭设置窗口导致的内存无上限增长：每次开关都会因 WinUI 3 已知的窗口关闭缺陷泄漏一整棵原生界面树（约 10 MB）。设置窗口改为复用——关闭即隐藏，再次打开时复用同一实例并刷新状态。
- 空闲深度内存回收被 120 秒冷却否决后不再放弃，改为退避重试，直到终结器回收真正执行。
- 切换格子材质不再销毁重建系统背景控制器（材质类型本身可变），消除了每次切换的原生句柄累积；DWM 主题属性仅在主题实际变化时重新下发。
- 以新设置项「空闲时压缩内存占用」恢复了 1.4.5 之前的空闲内存压缩（默认开启，位于性能设置）：隐藏后的深度清理完成时把工作集换出（例如 350 MB 压到 10 MB 以内）；格子可见时仅在用户完全离开且占用超过原有膨胀阈值时才执行。
- 加固文件打开交互：打开操作加闸与追踪，运行在有界的 STA 执行器上，文件项增加打开动画与文字缩放。
- 重命名为不同扩展名时使用 Windows 扩展名变更警告进行确认；叠放弹窗支持就地重命名。
- 稳定了 Windows 10/11 的完整文件拖拽协议：普通左键拖出不再弹出操作选择菜单，内部排序和叠放关系调整不再授权 Shell 删除源文件，弹窗与非弹窗模式均可在格子和叠放之间正常移入、移出。按拖拽会话隔离的载荷缓存和受边界保护的鼠标释放恢复，避免复用旧目标以及“有插入线但未提交”的问题。
- 文件格子的空状态改为跟随底层源集合，拖入第一个项目后立即隐藏，移出最后一个项目后立即恢复。
- Full Native AOT 直发包现在会补入并校验 Windows 10 通知初始化所需、由还原版本锁定的 Windows App Runtime Insights 资源及其架构。
- 启动注册重构为直连与商店两个服务，并补充契约测试。
- 发布验证：x64 测试套件 3118/3118 通过；Debug 与 Release Native AOT 构建均已验证（Release AOT 稳态：私有约 115 MB / 工作集约 171 MB）。

## 1.4.8 - 2026-08-29

### English

- Unified Direct releases on standard-named Full Native AOT installers that bundle the matching Windows App Runtime. In-place upgrades now remove only files owned by an older DeskBox payload, preventing obsolete private runtime DLLs from surviving across installer variants (issue #137).
- Resolved mapped folder junctions and symbolic links to their physical traversal paths at runtime while preserving the configured logical path, avoiding Windows RedirectionGuard failures and following junction retargets during refresh and watcher reconnects.
- Interactive file deletions now delegate confirmation to the Windows Shell, following each user's Explorer settings instead of a DeskBox dialog (issue #86). Permanent deletes use the native prompt, and Native AOT moves surface the system name-conflict dialog instead of silently overwriting. Background cleanup and rollback remain silent.
- Folder watchers that hit a persistent access-denied subtree (broken ACLs on a nested folder) now back off on a long interval with a single warning in the log, instead of restarting and erroring every few seconds. Recovery after fixing permissions or reconnecting a drive still happens automatically.
- A failing icon-only desktop.ini watcher no longer marks the whole folder as degraded; the listing and the main watcher keep working.
- Widgets created while no usable display work area existed (for example with a cloud-gaming virtual adapter as the primary display) are re-placed automatically once a usable display appears, instead of permanently stacking at default coordinates.
- DeskBox shows a one-time informational toast when the primary monitor is backed by a virtual display adapter; certain virtual GPU drivers are known to break WinUI 3 rendering and layout.
- Stack popovers keep their requested column count at fractional DPI scales (125%, 150%, …): the viewport reserve now scales with the grid shape, because per-item physical-pixel rounding adds up to one DIP per column and a fixed one-DIP reserve still wrapped 3-column grids into 2+1 rows.
- DeskBox maintains an independent `DeskBox Files.lnk` entry for the managed storage folder. Existing users keep the default-on behavior, the path follows a storage migration, and uninstall offers to create a collision-safe shortcut when managed files remain.
- Windows 10 now forces square widget and capsule-media corners at render time while preserving the user's saved preference for a later Windows 11 upgrade. Windows 11 continues to apply the selected corner mode to the outer window and embedded media surfaces.
- New installations and restored defaults now use the Standard weather skin, while the Rich skin remains available as an explicit choice.
- Search keyboard navigation now keeps the selected row and highlight synchronized after arrow-key movement and Ctrl+Tab tab cycling. Search tabs are text-only, content-sized, and use a taller, better-spaced selection indicator.

### 中文

- 直发版统一采用标准文件名的 Full Native AOT 安装包，并内置匹配架构的 Windows App Runtime。覆盖升级只清理由旧版 DeskBox 载荷拥有、且新版不再包含的文件，避免不同安装包形态切换后残留旧的专用运行时 DLL（issue #137）。
- 文件夹映射在运行时会将目录联接和符号链接解析到物理访问路径，同时保留用户配置的逻辑路径，避免 Windows RedirectionGuard 拒绝访问，并在刷新或监视器重连时跟随联接目标变化。
- 交互文件删除的确认交由 Windows Shell 原生对话框承担（issue #86），并跟随用户的资源管理器设置；永久删除使用系统提示，Native AOT 移动遇到同名冲突时显示系统处理界面而不再静默覆盖。后台清理和回滚仍保持静默。
- 文件夹监视器命中持久性拒绝访问的子目录（嵌套文件夹 ACL 损坏）时，按较长间隔退避并只记录一次警告，不再每几秒重启报错。修复权限或重新连接磁盘后仍会自动恢复。
- 仅用于刷新图标的 desktop.ini 监视器失败不再把整个文件夹标记为降级；列表和主监视器照常工作。
- 在没有可用显示器工作区时创建的格子（例如云游戏虚拟显卡作为主显示器），会在可用显示器出现后自动重新放置，不再永久堆叠在默认坐标。
- 当主显示器由虚拟显卡提供时，DeskBox 会给出一次性信息提示；已知部分虚拟 GPU 驱动会破坏 WinUI 3 的渲染与布局。
- 分数缩放（125%、150% 等）下叠放弹窗保持请求的列数：视口余量改为随网格形状伸缩——每列的逐项物理像素取整最多累积 1 DIP，固定的 1 DIP 余量仍会把 3 列网格挤成 2+1 换行。
- DeskBox 会维护一个独立的 `DeskBox Files.lnk` 快捷方式，指向当前收纳目录；老用户默认启用，收纳路径迁移后会跟随更新，卸载时发现仍有收纳文件则询问是否创建不会覆盖其他文件的快捷方式。
- Windows 10 在实际渲染时强制使用直角外框和胶囊媒体内图，同时保留用户保存的圆角偏好，之后升级到 Windows 11 可继续使用；Windows 11 会按所选圆角设置应用到窗口和媒体内图。
- 新安装和恢复默认设置时，天气默认使用简洁的标准样式，丰富样式仍可手动选择。
- 搜索上下键移动和 Ctrl+Tab 切换 Tab 后，选中文件与高亮保持同步；搜索 Tab 只保留文字，宽度按内容适配，指示条更高且与文字留有更舒适的间距。

## 1.4.7 - 2026-08-29

### English

- Moved extended Windows Shell context menus into an isolated helper process, so a faulty third-party Shell extension can no longer terminate the DeskBox process.
- Fixed 3x3 stack popovers wrapping five items as 2+2+1 at fractional DPI scales; the layout now reserves a physical-pixel-safe viewport and pins the requested row/column geometry explicitly.
- Kept hidden desktop-layer widgets hidden during Explorer drag and activation transitions, while preserving the expected peer order for expanded capsules.
- Restored Native AOT binding metadata for Glance calendar day decorations.

### 中文

- 将“更多系统操作”菜单移入独立辅助进程，第三方 Shell 扩展异常时不再连带结束 DeskBox 主进程。
- 修复 3x3 叠放弹窗在部分 2K、高 DPI 电脑上将五个项目错误排成 2+2+1 的问题；布局会预留覆盖物理像素舍入的视口空间，并明确固定行列尺寸。
- 修复在资源管理器桌面拖拽与激活状态切换期间，隐藏的桌面层格子偶发重新显示的问题，同时保持展开胶囊之间的正确层级。
- 补齐时光日历日期装饰数据的 Native AOT 绑定元数据。

## 1.4.6 - 2026-08-28

紧急修复了部分系统下，格子间拖动 `.lnk` 快捷方式会被误删除并进入回收站的严重问题。

### English

DeskBox 1.4.6 is a major feature, performance, and runtime update. The notes below cover everything added or changed since 1.4.3.

#### Important before updating

- DeskBox now uses Windows App SDK and Windows App Runtime 2.4 instead of 2.2. A PC that only has the 2.2 runtime will download and install 2.4 once during a Direct-installer update; this is expected and does not remove the older shared runtime used by other applications.
- The installer downloads Windows App Runtime 2.4 only when it is missing. A restart may be requested after runtime installation. For a fully offline update, install the matching x64 or ARM64 Windows App Runtime 2.4 first.
- GitHub Direct builds now use Native AOT and no longer download or require a separate .NET 10 runtime.
- Normal in-place updates keep the existing DeskBox settings, widget layouts, Todo, Quick Capture, and managed files. The updater also pins the current-user or all-users install scope so a silent update cannot switch scope unexpectedly.
- The minimum supported system remains Windows 10 21H2 (build 19044), and the Direct installer now enforces that requirement.

#### Performance and resource use

- Added Balanced, Resource saver, and Custom performance modes under Settings > General > Performance and resources.
- Custom mode can control hidden-widget cache cleanup, visible-idle cleanup, transient-window release, icon/thumbnail/image cache budget, and individual continuous animations such as text marquee, vinyl rotation, Glance image rotation, and capsule effects.
- Hidden and inactive widgets now release recreatable UI surfaces, decoded images, icons, and thumbnails according to the selected policy. Search and other temporary windows can also release their visual trees after remaining hidden.
- Reused process-wide WinRT settings objects, shared brushes, cached window factories, batched background work, and targeted stack updates reduce repeated allocations, redundant settings fan-out, and full list rebuilds.
- File widgets, Music, and other surfaces avoid unnecessary refreshes when their data is still current, reducing idle CPU and background work without delaying real changes.
- Window animation pacing adapts to the refresh rate of the current display, with additional frame-pacing and backdrop safeguards for Windows 10.

#### Multi-display layouts, movement, and reveal

- DeskBox now stores a separate widget layout for each known monitor topology. Reconnecting a previous display arrangement restores the positions, sizes, group surfaces, and capsule placement saved for that arrangement.
- Display hot-plug, work-area, and DPI changes are stabilized before restore, and layout writes are paused during the transition so temporary coordinates do not overwrite a known layout.
- A replacement or differently scaled monitor receives a proportional in-bounds layout instead of leaving widgets off-screen.
- Hold Ctrl while dragging a widget title to move all eligible widgets on the current display as one bounded group.
- Widget snapping now works while moving as well as resizing, supports a configurable gap, and keeps screen-edge placement inside the usable work area.
- Added a Quick Reveal layer for temporarily showing widgets above other windows without permanently changing their desktop-layer behavior.

#### Hotkeys and desktop activation

- Global activation now provides ready-made choices for F7 (default), double Ctrl, Alt+Space, Win+Space, and a standalone Win-key tap, while retaining custom shortcut recording.
- Reserved Windows combinations show their system-side effects before they are enabled; modifier chords and incomplete taps are rejected so they do not trigger DeskBox accidentally.
- Added an optional double-click on a blank desktop area to show or hide all widgets. Icon clicks and distant or slow clicks are excluded.
- Quick Reveal preserves the first activating click and dismisses only for the matching desktop action, reducing lost clicks and unexpected hides.

#### File stacking 2.0 and capsule interaction

- File stacking now separates the master switch from automatic grouping. Manual stacks remain available when automatic grouping is off, and automatic stacking is off by default for new users.
- A stack can open inline or in a separate popover. Popovers support Adaptive, 3×3, and 5×5 layouts, vertical overflow scrolling, and either the widget material or a neutral acrylic style.
- Popover placement follows the source stack and current work area, adapts to item count and file-widget layout, and stays within screen edges.
- Stack popovers now share the file grid's icon size, density, filename, selection, and Ctrl+mouse-wheel sizing behavior.
- Interacting with a popover, context menu, drag operation, title editor, or close confirmation keeps a hover-expand capsule or widget group open until the interaction is finished and the pointer has left.
- Switching between stacks no longer reveals the previous stack on the first frame. Reused popover windows bind and compose the new content while hidden before being shown.
- Fixed Native AOT popovers collapsing into one clipped column, repeated opening/closing retaining excess memory, duplicate item activation, and stale first-frame content.
- Capsule settings now use the expansion behavior as the main control. New widgets expand downward by default, the Sensitive hover preset uses 100 ms expand / 200 ms collapse delays, and the Relaxed animation preset consistently uses 360 ms.
- Fixed collapsed-capsule width changes reverting after pointer release on Windows 10, and kept group close confirmations operable while a group is collapsed or hover-expanded.

#### File widgets and Windows integration

- File and stack-popover selection now follows the Windows desktop shape more closely: the highlight fills the available row or column width with a narrow horizontal gap and adapts vertically to the icon and filename.
- File names can now be hidden in icon view in addition to the existing one-line and two-line choices. Each file widget can also override the global icon size, and widgets can be resized down to 50×50.
- Dragging files can follow the Windows default copy/move decision, including cross-volume behavior and modifier-key shortcut creation. Native drop images and target descriptions are used for Explorer, folders, stacks, and file widgets.
- Shell copy and move operations show per-item progress badges while keeping source, destination, and receiving folders protected from conflicting mutations.
- Added Create shortcut, Permanently delete with confirmation and partial-result reporting, and Run as administrator for supported executable targets. DeskBox itself remains at normal user privilege.
- The More menu opens near the originating mouse pointer, with a stable button fallback for keyboard or touch. More system operations uses a Windows 10-compatible native Shell path and reports invocation failures instead of silently succeeding.
- Folder and case-only renames are committed atomically, shortcut icons resolve through Shell PIDLs, and the duplicate full-path tooltip line was removed.

#### Search powered by Everything

- File search now reads Everything's existing index over local IPC and merges file and folder results with DeskBox notes, todos, and settings in the same search window.
- Settings can detect or launch Everything, choose its executable, show connection and permission status, opt into advanced Everything syntax, and filter low-value system/cache paths.
- DeskBox includes the IPC integration component but does not bundle or install the Everything application. File search requires Everything to be installed, running, and explicitly allowed in DeskBox.
- The legacy DeskBox-maintained file index, USN tracking, Windows Index integration, and native search core were removed. DeskBox-owned leftover index data is cleaned automatically, eliminating a duplicate background index.

#### Appearance, media, and everyday details

- Widget foregrounds can follow the app theme or use light, dark, or custom text and monochrome-control colors, with an optional text edge treatment and per-widget overrides.
- Glance adds independent background-image transparency, while Music can switch between available media sessions or follow the system-selected source.
- Todo manual reordering, notification actions, Quick Capture attachments, Glance switching, and feature-widget settings were hardened for Native AOT builds.
- Desktop organization can optionally include retained folders, large files, and items beyond the quick batch, and now explains access-denied, in-use, changed, unavailable, or failed transfers separately.
- Onboarding can recommend a suitable internal non-system drive for managed files. If the selected storage drive is temporarily disconnected, widgets remain intact and recover after the drive returns.
- Weather startup uses fresh cached forecasts immediately, preserves manual locations, bounds automatic retries, and keeps refresh work off the interaction path.

#### Startup, persistence, and packaging reliability

- Startup no longer forces Explorer to create a desktop host while Windows is restoring desktop icon positions. Widget restoration proceeds immediately, while desktop-layer attachment waits for Explorer's existing icon host to stabilize.
- Auto-start now uses the per-user Run entry and appears in Windows Startup apps. Legacy task registrations are migrated when safe, and disabling DeskBox from Windows is reflected by the in-app switch.
- Fixed a Microsoft Store persistence failure that could restore settings and widget data from an older state after reopening DeskBox. Atomic replacement now retries and uses a verified backup/write-through fallback when Windows temporarily blocks destination removal.
- Native AOT compatibility fixes restore settings dropdowns, file stacks, Glance, Music, Todo, Quick Capture, image attachments, support QR images, and multiple-widget switching in Direct builds.
- Installer filenames remain `DeskBox_Setup_<version>_<arch>.exe`, preserving the update contract used by 1.4.3. Direct installers continue to be produced for x64 and ARM64.

### 中文

DeskBox 1.4.6 是一次大型功能、性能与运行环境更新。以下内容为相对 1.4.3 的全部主要变化。

#### 更新前必读

- DeskBox 使用的 Windows App SDK 与 Windows App Runtime 已从 2.2 升级到 2.4。如果电脑只有 2.2，使用官网下载的直发安装包更新时会额外下载并安装一次 2.4；这是正常升级流程，也不会删除其他应用仍在使用的旧版共享运行时。
- 安装器只在缺少 2.4 时下载。安装运行时后，少数电脑可能需要重启。完全离线更新时，请先手动安装与电脑架构一致的 x64 或 ARM64 Windows App Runtime 2.4。
- GitHub 直发版改为 Native AOT 构建，不再需要也不再下载单独的 .NET 10 运行时。
- 正常覆盖更新会沿用现有 DeskBox 设置、格子布局、待办、随记和收纳文件。更新器会固定当前用户或所有用户安装范围，避免静默更新时意外切换安装位置。
- 最低支持系统仍为 Windows 10 21H2（build 19044），直发安装器现在会明确执行这项检查。

#### 性能与资源占用

- 设置 > 常规新增“性能与资源”，提供“均衡”“节省资源”和“自定义”三种性能模式。
- 自定义模式可分别控制格子隐藏后的缓存回收、可见但闲置时的缓存回收、临时窗口释放、图标/缩略图/解码图片缓存容量，以及文字跑马灯、唱片旋转、时光图片切换、胶囊光效与粒子等持续动画。
- 隐藏和非活动格子会按所选策略释放可重建的界面、解码图片、图标和缩略图；搜索等临时窗口长期隐藏后也可释放界面树。
- 复用进程级 WinRT 设置对象、共享画刷、缓存窗口工厂、批处理后台任务，并让叠放只更新实际变化的条目，减少重复分配、设置广播和整表重建。
- 文件格子、音乐等界面会跳过数据仍然有效时的重复刷新，降低闲置 CPU 和后台工作，同时仍会及时响应真实变化。
- 窗口动画会按当前显示器刷新率调整节拍，并为 Windows 10 增加帧节奏和背景材质保护。

#### 多显示器、布局移动与快捷唤起

- DeskBox 会为不同的显示器拓扑分别保存格子布局。重新接入使用过的屏幕组合后，会恢复该组合对应的位置、尺寸、格子组表面和胶囊位置。
- 显示器热插拔、工作区变化和 DPI 变化会先等待状态稳定再恢复；切换期间暂停写入布局，避免临时坐标覆盖已经保存的布局。
- 更换显示器或缩放比例变化时，会按可用工作区比例映射布局，并把格子限制在屏幕范围内，减少格子跑到屏幕外。
- 按住 Ctrl 拖动格子标题，可以把当前显示器上的可移动格子作为一个整体移动，并确保整体不越出工作区。
- 格子吸附同时支持移动和调整尺寸，可设置相邻格子间距，并保证贴近屏幕边缘时仍在可用工作区内。
- 新增“快捷唤起层”，可临时把格子显示在其他窗口上方，不会永久改变其桌面层级行为。

#### 快捷键与桌面唤起

- 全局唤起新增 F7（默认）、双击 Ctrl、Alt+Space、Win+Space、单独按 Win 等预设，同时保留自定义快捷键录制。
- 启用会占用 Windows 行为的组合前会显示明确提示；修饰键组合、未完成按键和系统掩码会被正确排除，减少误触发。
- 新增可选的“双击桌面空白区域显示或隐藏全部格子”，点击桌面图标、间距过远或超时的两次点击不会触发。
- 快捷唤起会保留第一次用于操作格子的点击，只响应匹配的桌面动作进行收起，减少点击丢失和意外隐藏。

#### 文件叠放 2.0 与胶囊交互

- 文件叠放拆分为叠放总开关与自动叠放开关。关闭自动归组后仍可使用手动叠放；新用户默认保留叠放功能，但不会自动把文件归组。
- 点击叠放可选择“当前布局内展开”或“弹出式展开”。弹窗提供自适应、3×3、5×5 布局，内容超出后纵向滚动，并可选择跟随格子材质或使用中性亚克力样式。
- 叠放弹窗会根据来源位置、当前屏幕工作区、文件数量和格子布局自适应尺寸与位置，并保持在屏幕边缘以内。
- 叠放弹窗与文件格子共用图标大小、密度、文件名、选中状态和 Ctrl+鼠标滚轮缩放逻辑。
- 操作叠放弹窗、右键菜单、拖放、标题编辑或关闭确认时，悬停展开的胶囊和格子组会保持展开；交互结束且鼠标移出后才会收起。
- 在不同叠放间切换时，不再在首帧闪现上一次打开的内容。复用窗口会在隐藏状态下完成新内容绑定和合成后再显示。
- 修复 Native AOT 下叠放弹窗退化为单列并裁切内容、反复开关保留过多内存、同一项目重复触发以及复用窗口首帧残留等问题。
- 胶囊设置改为以“展开方式”为主控制项。新格子默认向下展开，“灵敏”悬停预设改为展开 100 ms / 收起 200 ms，“舒缓”动画统一为 360 ms。
- 修复 Windows 10 上收起状态调整胶囊宽度后松手回弹，以及格子组收起或悬停展开时无法操作关闭确认的问题。

#### 文件格子与 Windows 操作

- 文件格子和叠放弹窗的选中区域更接近 Windows 桌面：横向铺满可用列宽并保留窄间距，纵向根据图标和文件名高度自适应。
- 图标视图的文件名除了单行、双行外，还可选择隐藏。每个文件格子可以单独覆盖全局图标大小，格子最小可调整到 50×50。
- 拖入文件可选择“跟随 Windows 默认”，正确处理跨磁盘复制以及修饰键创建快捷方式；资源管理器、文件夹、叠放和文件格子使用原生拖放图像与目标说明。
- Windows Shell 复制和移动会显示逐项进度标记，并在传输期间保护来源、目标和接收文件夹，减少互相冲突的操作。
- 新增“创建快捷方式”“永久删除”和“使用管理员身份打开”。永久删除带二次确认和部分失败结果；管理员权限只用于所选目标，DeskBox 本身继续以普通用户权限运行。
- “更多”菜单会优先出现在本次点击位置附近，键盘或触控操作则回退到按钮锚点。“更多系统操作”改用兼容 Windows 10 的原生 Shell 路径，并在调用失败时报告错误。
- 文件夹重命名和仅修改大小写的重命名改为原子提交，快捷方式图标通过 Shell PIDL 解析，完整路径悬浮提示的重复行也已移除。

#### 搜索改用 Everything

- 文件搜索通过本机 IPC 读取 Everything 已有索引，并把文件、文件夹结果与 DeskBox 的随记、待办和设置合并在同一搜索窗口。
- 设置页可以检测或启动 Everything、手动选择程序、查看连接与权限状态、选择是否允许高级 Everything 语法，并过滤低价值系统与缓存路径。
- DeskBox 随包提供 IPC 集成组件，但不会捆绑或安装 Everything 应用。使用文件搜索需要自行安装并运行 Everything，并在 DeskBox 中明确授权。
- 旧的 DeskBox 自建文件索引、USN 跟踪、Windows 索引集成和原生搜索核心已移除；DeskBox 自己留下的旧索引数据会自动清理，不再维护第二份后台索引。

#### 外观、媒体与日常细节

- 格子文字和单色控件可跟随应用主题，也可选择浅色、深色或自定义颜色，并支持文字边缘效果和单个格子独立覆盖。
- 时光新增独立的背景图片透明度；音乐可在可用媒体会话之间切换，也可跟随系统当前选择的播放源。
- 待办手动排序与通知操作、随记附件、时光切换和功能格子设置在 Native AOT 版本下完成兼容加固。
- 桌面整理可自行选择是否包含文件夹、大文件和超出快速批次的项目，并分别说明无权限、占用中、预览后变化、暂不可用或传输失败等保留原因。
- 新手引导可以推荐合适的内部非系统磁盘存放收纳文件。所选存储盘临时断开时，格子保持原样，磁盘重新连接后自动恢复。
- 天气启动时优先使用仍有效的本地缓存，保留手动位置，并限制自动重试频率，刷新过程不会阻塞主要交互。

#### 启动、数据保存与安装可靠性

- 开机启动时不再强制 Explorer 创建桌面宿主，避免与 Windows 恢复桌面图标位置发生竞争。格子本身会正常恢复，桌面层挂接则等待 Explorer 已有的图标宿主稳定后再完成。
- 开机自启改用用户级 Run 项，并显示在 Windows“启动应用”中；旧计划任务会在安全时迁移，在系统中关闭 DeskBox 后应用内开关也会同步。
- 修复 Microsoft Store 版本可能在重启后恢复旧设置和旧格子数据的问题。原子替换遇到 Windows 暂时阻止删除目标文件时，会重试并使用经过校验的备份与原位写入兜底。
- Native AOT 兼容修复覆盖设置下拉框、文件叠放、时光、音乐、待办、随记、图片附件、支持二维码和多个功能格子切换。
- 安装包继续使用 `DeskBox_Setup_<版本>_<架构>.exe` 命名，保持 1.4.3 使用的更新契约；直发安装器继续提供 x64 与 ARM64 架构。

## 1.4.3 - 2026-08-19

### English

#### Windows 10 motion and materials

- Windows 10 startup now treats a rejected tray Efficiency Mode request as an optional optimization failure, so `WidgetManager` initialization and desktop organization can continue.
- Widget resize, capsule transitions, and full-widget expand or collapse keep moving the real widget windows while reducing redundant UI-thread work and repeated window-position updates.
- Resize guidance is updated more efficiently and restores the illuminated edge feedback without placing a placeholder over the widget.
- Windows 10 receives a dedicated material compatibility path. Unsupported Mica and system-corner choices are identified as Windows 11-only, while acrylic, solid, and fully transparent modes retain their Windows 10 behavior.
- Rapidly interrupted animations now hand off to the latest operation more cleanly, reducing delayed or sticky responses during repeated interaction.

#### Traditional Chinese

- Traditional Chinese (`zh-TW`) is available throughout the app and in both x64 and ARM64 installers.
- Language persistence, update notes, weather descriptions, city search, lunar calendar content, Todo, Quick Capture, and desktop organization now distinguish Simplified and Traditional Chinese.
- Traditional Chinese terminology and punctuation were reviewed for Taiwan usage, with complete resource-key and formatting-placeholder parity across all supported languages.

#### Release packages

- x64 and ARM64 are available as recommended framework-dependent installers and as larger `_Full` offline installers containing private .NET and Windows App Runtime components.

### 中文

#### Windows 10 动画与材质

- Windows 10 拒绝托盘效率模式请求时，会将其视为可选优化失败，继续完成 `WidgetManager` 初始化和桌面整理。
- 格子边缘调整、胶囊切换以及完整格子的展开和收起继续驱动真实窗口，同时减少 UI 线程上的重复计算和窗口位置更新。
- 调整尺寸时的辅助提示改为更轻量的更新方式，并恢复边缘发光反馈，不会用预占位替代真实格子。
- Windows 10 使用独立的材质兼容路径。设置会明确提示云母与系统圆角仅适用于 Windows 11，同时保留亚克力、纯色和全透明模式在 Windows 10 上的对应行为。
- 连续快速操作时，新动画会更顺畅地接替未完成的旧动画，减少延迟和粘滞感。

#### 繁體中文

- 應用程式與 x64、ARM64 安裝程式新增繁體中文（`zh-TW`）。
- 語言儲存、更新說明、天氣描述、城市搜尋、農曆內容、待辦、隨記與桌面整理均能區分簡體和繁體中文。
- 繁中詞彙與標點已按臺灣使用習慣複核，所有支援語言的資源鍵和格式化預留位置保持一致。

#### 发布包

- x64 与 ARM64 同时提供推荐的框架依赖安装包，以及内置专用 .NET 与 Windows App Runtime 的 `_Full` 离线完整包。

## 1.4.2 - 2026-08-16

### English

#### Todo and Quick Capture

- Todo checkmarks stay with the intended task under custom sorting and filtering. Unchecking an item in Completed removes only that task without clearing the next row's checkmark.
- Single-pane Todo detail now uses a clear back arrow and removes the duplicate completion control. Header actions use consistent spacing and a compact frosted surface.
- Clipboard images in Quick Capture show thumbnails in both list and detail views. Copying an image record writes the image itself back to Windows instead of a local path.
- Todo and Quick Capture share equal-size attachment tiles. Images show thumbnails, other files show file icons, and the horizontal strip reveals a remove button on hover.
- Records and Pinned keep their empty states after repeated tab changes. Pinned has its own add card and creates pinned content directly.
- Meaningful Quick Capture drafts are saved before switching records, while an empty draft no longer blocks navigation or creates a blank entry.
- Newly created Todo and Quick Capture widgets include editable localized guides. Resetting either feature restores its guide so the main functions remain easy to discover.
- Markdown tables, code, links, task lists, emphasis, and pasted images render more consistently. Text and semantic accent colors remain readable in both light and dark themes.
- Quick Capture search now opens in the tab row instead of adding another line. The field's clear button removes the query, while Cancel or Esc closes search and restores the tabs.

#### File widgets, stacks, and previews

- Manual stacks remain available when automatic stacking is turned off. Changing the members or order of an automatic stack converts it to a manual stack so later rule updates do not overwrite the change.
- Files can be dragged into a stack from File Explorer, a browser, or another file widget. Members can be removed individually, a stack can be dissolved, and a stack with one remaining member dissolves automatically.
- Dragging an item out of a widget no longer changes its sorting mode. Reordering inside a stack stays local to that stack instead of rearranging the entire file widget.
- Stack expand and collapse transitions use dedicated motion, keyboard handling, focus recovery, and clearer ownership cues. Drop highlights and pulsing borders are cleared as soon as a drag ends.
- File-type and custom stacking rules now follow the selected mode independently, avoiding unexpected groups produced by two rule sets at once.
- Files and applications opened from a file widget now launch through the Explorer desktop shell. They receive the same user environment as desktop-launched items, improving compatibility with local development tools, services, and globally installed integrations.
- When QuickLook reaches the edge of the current file widget, arrow-key navigation can continue into an adjacent visible file widget without closing the preview.

#### Capsule mode, widget groups, and desktop layer

- Capsule expansion direction can be set to Auto, Down, or Up. Fixed directions keep the title edge anchored, including after widgets are hidden and restored with F7.
- Hover auto-expand reconnects after mode changes, hiding, and restoring. Hiding a widget also clears stale hover state and the temporary drag mask.
- Widgets assigned to the desktop layer stay there when their title or empty area is clicked. Dynamic-layer widgets keep their existing temporary foreground behavior.
- Expanding, collapsing, and resizing widgets release interrupted animation work more reliably, making repeated compact-mode operations feel smoother.
- Group wheel navigation no longer stalls during rapid input or jumps two members from one effective step. One switch produces one background highlight instead of repeated flashing.
- First-to-last circular navigation remains available, so continuous wheel movement can keep cycling through the group.
- Newer navigation requests replace unfinished older ones without rolling back an already visible member. Collapsed groups also show a compact position indicator.
- Widgets recover their desktop position more reliably after interaction, display changes, or Win+D, reducing unexpected overlap above other applications.

#### Music and interface polish

- Music transport controls use filled Windows-style icons. Play, pause, previous, and next share one responsive size, while repeat and volume remain compact auxiliary controls.
- Cover mode uses a taller frosted control strip with left-aligned song information and a tighter single-line layout. Record and control modes receive matching spacing and hover treatment.
- Todo, Quick Capture, onboarding, desktop organization, and release notes use clearer frosted action surfaces with more consistent margins and compact controls.
- The floating search window's drag handle uses an opaque light or dark color, avoiding the visible center overlap caused by translucent layers.
- Feature-widget settings use the same colorful icons as widget title bars, with card spacing aligned to the rest of Settings. Several unclear settings descriptions are shorter and more direct.
- The title-bar add button opens the same widget-creation menu from file and feature widgets. Todo and Quick Capture keep their content-specific new-item actions inside their workspaces.

#### Onboarding, search, and smaller details

- The opening logo animation is slower and fades smoothly into the first onboarding step without shrinking toward the corner. The product message stays visible long enough to read.
- Onboarding moves through the main actions more directly and keeps feature-widget choices synchronized with Settings.
- Background search refreshes retain unchanged rows, selection, and resolved icons, reducing visible rebuilding and flicker.
- Weekly high and low temperatures use the same visual scale as their day labels, and several empty, hover, and compact states now follow one consistent style.

### 中文

#### 待办与随记

- 自定义排序和筛选时，待办勾选始终对应实际任务。在“已完成”中取消勾选只会移出当前任务，不会让下一项丢失勾选状态。
- 待办单列详情使用明确的返回箭头，并移除重复的完成按钮。标题与右侧操作获得更合理的空间，顶部加入紧凑磨砂背景。
- 随记剪贴板图片会在列表和详情中显示缩略图。复制图片记录时，写回 Windows 剪贴板的是图片本身，不再是本地路径。
- 待办与随记共用等尺寸附件方块。图片显示缩略图，其他文件显示文件图标，可横向滚动，鼠标移入后出现删除按钮。
- “随记”和“固定”反复切换后仍会显示正确空状态。固定页加入新增卡片，从这里创建的内容会直接固定。
- 切换到其他随记前会先保存有效草稿。空白草稿不会阻止切换，也不会产生空记录。
- 首次创建待办或随记格子时，会加入可编辑、可删除的本地化功能说明。重置数据后也会恢复对应说明。
- Markdown 表格、代码、链接、任务列表、强调文字和粘贴图片显示更加稳定。浅色与深色主题下的正文和语义色都保持清晰。
- 随记搜索会在标签栏原位置展开，不再额外占用一行。输入框内的清除按钮只清空关键词，点击“取消”或按 Esc 才会退出搜索并恢复标签栏。

#### 文件格子、叠放与预览

- 关闭自动叠放后，手动创建的叠放仍会保留。调整自动叠放的成员或顺序后，该组会转为手动叠放，后续规则更新不会覆盖用户操作。
- 支持从资源管理器、浏览器和其他文件格子直接拖入叠放。成员可以单独移出，也可以解散整个叠放，只剩一个成员时会自动解散。
- 将文件拖出格子不会意外切换排序方式。叠放内部的排序只影响当前叠放，不会改变整个文件格子的顺序。
- 叠放使用专门的展开与收起动画，并补齐键盘操作、焦点恢复和归属提示。拖放结束后，高亮和呼吸边框会立即清理。
- 文件类型与自定义叠放规则会按当前选中的模式分别生效，不再同时叠加并产生意外分组。
- 从文件格子打开文件或应用时，改由资源管理器桌面 Shell 执行。启动后的程序会获得与桌面启动一致的用户环境，本地开发工具、服务和全局扩展能够更可靠地读取已有配置。
- QuickLook 浏览到当前文件格子边界后，可以继续使用方向键切换到相邻的可见文件格子，无需关闭预览。

#### 胶囊模式、格子组与桌面层级

- 胶囊展开方向新增“自动”“向下”和“向上”三种选择。固定方向会保持标题边缘作为锚点，F7 隐藏再显示后也不会发生位置漂移。
- 切换模式、隐藏或重新显示格子后，悬停自动展开会重新挂接。隐藏格子时也会清理旧的悬停状态和临时拖动遮罩。
- 固定在桌面层的格子，点击标题或空白区域后仍会留在桌面层。动态层级继续保留原有的临时前置交互。
- 优化格子展开、收起和尺寸变化时的动画衔接，连续操作时更少出现卡顿、中断或残留动画。
- 格子组快速滚动不再出现切不动或一次跳过两个成员的情况。一次有效滚轮输入只切换一个格子，并只播放一次背景提示。
- 保留首尾循环，持续向同一方向滚动可以一直循环切换格子组成员。
- 新的切换请求会接替尚未完成的旧请求，不会把已经显示的成员切回去。收起后的格子组还会显示简洁的位置指示。
- 操作格子、切换显示器或按下 Win+D 后，格子会更可靠地回到正确桌面层级，减少意外压在其他窗口上方的情况。

#### 音乐与界面细节

- 音乐播放控件改用接近 Windows 媒体控制的面性图标。播放、暂停、上一首和下一首使用统一响应式尺寸，循环和音量继续保持较小规格。
- 封面模式采用更高的磨砂控制条、左对齐歌曲信息和紧凑单行布局。唱片与控制模式同步调整间距和悬浮效果。
- 待办、随记、新手引导、桌面整理和更新日志的操作区加入更清楚的磨砂层，并统一边距与紧凑控件尺寸。
- 悬浮搜索窗口顶部拖动手势条改为适配浅色与深色主题的纯色，避免半透明图层重叠造成中间发灰。
- 功能格子设置改用标题栏同款彩色图标，卡片间距与其他设置页保持一致，多项难以理解的说明也已缩短。
- 文件格子和全部功能格子的标题栏添加按钮统一打开格子创建菜单。待办与随记继续通过内容区内的入口新建任务或笔记。

#### 新手引导、搜索与其他细节

- 开场 Logo 动画放慢，并通过渐隐平滑进入第一步，不再向左上角缩小。产品说明会停留足够时间，方便用户读完。
- 新手引导更直接地介绍主要操作，功能格子开关会立即生效，并与设置页保持同步。
- 搜索结果后台刷新时会保留未变化的结果、选择状态和图标，减少列表重建与闪烁。
- 天气周视图的高低温与日期标签使用统一视觉比例，多处空状态、悬浮状态和紧凑控件也完成统一。

## 1.4.1 - 2026-08-12

### English

#### File widget polish

- File-widget scrollbars now appear during pointer, wheel, and keyboard activity, then hide after three seconds without interaction.
- Grid and list layouts share the same scrollbar activity tracking and release their timer when the surface is unloaded or disposed.

#### Visibility reliability

- Hide All now cancels pending automatic and topmost safety restoration before the hide animation begins.
- Desktop-layer restoration is rejected for hidden, actively hiding, or closing widgets, preventing stale callbacks from reopening windows after the user hides them.
- Application, package, x64 installer, and ARM64 installer versions are aligned on 1.4.1 / 1.4.1.0.

### 中文

#### 文件格子细节

- 文件格子的滚动条会在鼠标移动、滚轮和键盘操作时出现，连续 3 秒无操作后自动隐藏。
- 图标与列表布局共用滚动条活动跟踪；界面卸载或释放时会停止并解除对应定时器。

#### 显隐可靠性

- “全部收起”会在隐藏动画开始前取消尚未执行的自动恢复和置顶安全恢复。
- 已隐藏、正在收起或关闭中的格子会拒绝桌面层恢复，避免旧回调在用户主动隐藏后重新显示窗口。
- 应用、应用包、x64 安装器和 ARM64 安装器版本统一为 1.4.1 / 1.4.1.0。

## 1.4.0 - 2026-08-11

### English

#### Todo and Quick Capture workspaces

- Todo and Quick Capture now share a responsive master/detail foundation. Narrow widgets use a focused single-pane flow; wide widgets can keep the list and editor visible together with a persisted, adjustable splitter.
- Standalone and grouped Quick Capture hosts now use the same surface, layout policy, tab visibility, preview-line limit, material refresh, selection restore, and edit behavior.
- Todo notes and Quick Capture records gain native Markdown editing and safe preview, including formatting commands, task lists, tables, source-preserving edits, configurable Enter behavior, and compatibility with existing plain-text records.
- Quick Capture attachments can be removed directly while editing in the shared host. Pending files and persisted attachments follow the same empty-record safeguards as the standalone editor.

#### Settings and live application

- Todo and Quick Capture settings now use the same compact hierarchy: the feature switch comes first, wide-layout behavior follows it, related controls are grouped in native expanders, and related display choices use concise multi-selection menus.
- Quick Capture wide-open mode, tab visibility, list preview lines, Markdown defaults, and Enter behavior now update both active hosts instead of waiting for a reconstruction or affecting only the legacy window.
- Weather view selection is no longer overwritten by the segmented control's template default during initialization. Explicit Day or Week choices persist even when they match the global default.
- Quick Capture materials refresh correctly after recycled list containers, theme changes, view switches, and unsaved paper-style changes. Clipboard-history rows cannot inherit a saved note's paper color.

#### Capsule, groups, and desktop layer

- Smart hover expansion is rearmed after a Todo or Quick Capture member is switched into an existing group window. Real pointer movement can repair a missing routed entry event, and a deliberate dwell over title controls can expand without stealing an active click.
- Segmented tabs are realized against the final expanded width before the capsule animation starts, preventing Todo and Quick Capture tabs from appearing after the body.
- Rapid group-member wheel input is coalesced per surface, while completed live presenter swaps are protected from stale cancellation callbacks.
- Temporary title and interaction raises are tracked with generation-safe leases. The complete batch returns to the desktop layer after interaction, and stale delayed callbacks cannot release a newer raise.
- Desktop-layer ownership is reasserted during idle normalization so moving or interacting with a widget does not leave it above applications or break its Win+D desktop behavior.

#### Memory and reliability

- Hidden widgets now perform a soft cleanup after 30 seconds: dead localization targets, file metadata, icon and thumbnail caches, an unused search shell, eligible managed objects, and a high working set are released without waiting for the deep-cleanup timer.
- When widgets remain visible but DeskBox has had no foreground, pointer, settings, search, onboarding, or widget interaction for 30 seconds, visible-idle maintenance releases caches and performs allocation-aware managed collection. Any new activity restarts the idle window.
- The heavy-cleanup marker is always consumed, preventing a stale flag from permanently disabling visible-idle maintenance and compact-expansion warmup.
- Version metadata is aligned across the application, package manifest, x64 installer, and ARM64 installer at 1.4.0 / 1.4.0.0.

### 中文

#### 待办与随记工作区

- 待办与随记统一使用响应式列表/详情基础结构。窄格子采用聚焦单页流程，宽格子可以同时展示列表和编辑区，并保存可调整的分隔条位置。
- 独立随记和组内随记改为使用同一共享宿主，宽屏布局、顶部标签、列表预览行数、纸张材质、选择恢复和编辑行为保持一致。
- 待办备注与随记加入原生 Markdown 编辑和安全预览，支持格式命令、任务列表、表格、保留源文的编辑方式和可配置回车行为；已有纯文本记录继续兼容。
- 共享随记宿主补齐附件删除。未保存文件和已持久化附件都可以在编辑状态直接移除，并继续遵守空记录保护。

#### 设置与即时生效

- 待办与随记设置统一为紧凑层级：顶部先展示功能总开关，其后是宽屏布局；同类配置收进原生风琴，相关显示项使用简洁的多选菜单。
- 随记宽屏打开方式、顶部标签、列表预览行数、Markdown 默认格式和回车行为会同步更新当前共享宿主，不再只影响旧窗口或必须重建后才生效。
- 修复天气分段控件在初始化时用模板默认值覆盖真实设置的问题。用户明确选择的日视图或周视图会可靠保存，包括与全局默认相同的选择。
- 修复随记列表复用、主题变化、标签切换和未保存纸张样式下的材质刷新；剪贴板记录不会再继承其他随记的纸张颜色。

#### 胶囊、格子组与桌面层级

- 待办或随记切换进已有格子组窗口后，会重新挂接悬停自动展开。真实鼠标移动可以修复缺失的进入事件，鼠标停在标题控制区也可经过稳妥延迟后展开，同时不会抢走正在发生的点击。
- 胶囊展开前会按最终宽度预先准备顶部分段标签，避免待办和随记的标签晚于正文出现。
- 格子组的连续滚轮请求会按窗口合并，已经完成的真实内容切换也不会被旧的取消回调撤销。
- 标题点击和交互触发的临时前置改用带代次的租约管理。整批格子会在交互结束后回到桌面层，旧延迟回调无法释放后来的新状态。
- 空闲层级校正会重新确认桌面宿主关系，避免移动或操作格子后长期压在其他应用上方，或导致 Win+D 保留桌面格子的行为失效。

#### 内存与可靠性

- 全部格子隐藏 30 秒后执行轻量回收，释放无效本地化订阅、文件元数据、图标与缩略图缓存、闲置搜索壳、符合条件的托管对象和过高工作集，无需等待深度回收定时器。
- 格子仍显示时，若 DeskBox 连续 30 秒没有前台、鼠标、设置、搜索、新手引导或格子交互，也会释放缓存并按新增分配量执行托管回收；任何新操作都会重新计算空闲时间。
- 修复重度清理标记未被消费后长期阻止可见空闲回收和胶囊预热的问题。
- 应用、应用包、x64 安装器和 ARM64 安装器版本统一为 1.4.0 / 1.4.0.0。

## 1.3.9 - 2026-08-09

### English

#### Capsule mode and startup

- Smart auto-hide now synchronizes from the physical pointer when the mode is entered, retries collapses deferred by menus or interaction, and limits concurrent bounds animations during bulk state changes.
- The currently expanded capsule holds an explicit peer-layer lease so another DeskBox widget cannot cover it. Stale collapse callbacks cannot release the newer expanded widget.
- A new application session restores every enabled standalone widget and the active member of each widget group. Shutdown no longer persists process teardown as a user-requested hidden state.
- Group-title wheel navigation wraps and retains its pending member until preparation, persistence, and content switching finish.

#### Selection, drag, and keyboard parity

- Dragging from a multi-selection now preserves the full batch in file widgets, search results, standalone Quick Capture, and grouped Quick Capture.
- Internal drag payloads retain mixed file and folder paths instead of dropping folders when files are present.
- Quick Capture tab drops apply every dragged item, and Delete handles all selected Quick Capture or Todo rows.

#### Large transfers and cancellation

- Transfer UI appears during preparation, uses indeterminate progress while byte totals are unknown, and ignores stale callbacks from an earlier operation.
- Pressing Cancel immediately changes the card to an explicit canceling state with a progress indicator. The transfer pipeline reports canceling and canceled phases in order.
- Cross-volume moves use cancellable streamed copies. Same-volume moves keep their atomic path, read-only source files can be removed safely, progress callbacks are throttled for large batches, and canceled batches roll back completed work where possible.

#### First-run experience

- The onboarding flow is reduced to one introduction, two optional real exercises, and a final choice. Forced path confirmation and repeated explanation panels are removed.
- Managed file drops are explained as Move by default. File and visibility exercises complete only after their actual operation succeeds.
- The 2.5-second DeskBox logo sequence remains, while each step now pairs concise text with native icons, state diagrams, and icon-backed progress feedback.
- Application, package, x64 installer, and ARM64 installer versions are aligned on 1.3.9 / 1.3.9.0.

### 中文

#### 胶囊模式与启动恢复

- 进入悬停自动展开时会按真实鼠标位置同步状态。菜单或交互暂时阻止收起后会继续重试，批量切换时也会限制同时执行的尺寸动画。
- 当前展开的胶囊会持有独立的同级窗口层级。旧的收起回调无法清除后来展开的格子，其他 DeskBox 格子也不会盖住当前内容。
- 新的应用会话会恢复所有已启用的独立格子，以及每个格子组当前使用的成员。退出进程不再把窗口关闭误记为用户主动隐藏。
- 格子组标题滚轮支持循环切换，并会保留待切换目标，直到准备、保存和内容切换全部结束。

#### 多选拖拽与键盘操作

- 从文件格子、搜索结果、独立随记和组内随记拖出多选内容时，会保留完整选择。
- 内部拖拽同时包含文件与文件夹时，所有路径都会进入同一批载荷。
- 随记拖到标签页时会处理全部选中项。在随记或待办中按 Delete 也会处理当前全部选择。

#### 大文件进度与取消

- 准备传输时就会显示进度界面。总字节数尚未确定时使用不确定进度，也不会接收上一轮任务遗留的回调。
- 点击取消后，界面立即显示取消中和进度指示。传输层会依次报告取消中与已取消。
- 跨盘移动改为可取消的流式复制，同盘移动继续使用原子操作。只读源文件可以安全删除，大批小文件会限制进度回调频率，取消整批任务时会尽量撤回已经完成的内容。

#### 新手引导

- 引导调整为一屏介绍、两次可跳过的真实练习和结束选择，去掉强制路径确认与重复说明。
- 收纳格子的默认拖入行为明确为移动。文件练习和显隐练习只有在真实操作成功后才完成。
- DeskBox Logo 动画保留为 2.5 秒，每一步加入原生图标、状态示意和带图标的进度反馈。
- 应用、应用包、x64 安装器和 ARM64 安装器版本统一为 1.3.9 / 1.3.9.0。

## 1.3.8 - 2026-08-08

### English

#### Highlights

- Added Hindi, Spanish, French, Arabic, Bengali, and Russian language options. System-language detection, package resources, weather, update messages, onboarding, and core file-widget flows now recognize all six locales.
- Standardized product wording around file widgets, folder mapping, automatic stacks, widget groups, tray creation, and Move to Recycle Bin.
- The first file widget opens on the right, explains managed storage and folder mapping, and points users to the system tray when they need another widget.
- Fixed pasting from the desktop into a file widget, copying or cutting multiple selected files to Explorer, and stale cut-state visuals after a completed move.

#### Reliability and updates

- Startup activation, command-line fallback, and interactive launches now share one policy. Startup stays silent and tray-first, while a deliberate launch remains interactive.
- The initial file widget is created only for a genuinely new profile. Removing every file widget is respected, and settings recovery does not recreate one unexpectedly.
- Dynamic widgets remain on the desktop when using Win+D, while still raising above other applications when explicitly invoked.
- Uninstall now offers a safe choice between keeping application data for a later reinstall and permanently removing settings, widget layouts, notes, tasks, caches, logs, update files, and recovery snapshots. Files in the configured managed-storage location are always preserved.
- Localized installer, dependency, upgrade, and uninstall messages now substitute paths and item counts correctly; all six new installer languages also pass the matching locale to DeskBox on first launch.
- ARM64 updates now use their own installer URL, SHA-256, and size from the stable manifest.
- Application, package, x64 installer, and ARM64 installer versions are aligned on 1.3.8 / 1.3.8.0.

#### Localization scope

- The new language packs prioritize the main file-widget, onboarding, weather, and update experiences. Less-used detailed settings temporarily fall back to English rather than mixing in unrelated Chinese text.
- The x64 and ARM64 installers now offer the same eleven selectable interface languages as DeskBox, including localized dependency download and uninstall messages.

### 中文

#### 更新亮点

- 新增印地语、西班牙语、法语、阿拉伯语、孟加拉语和俄语。系统语言识别、应用包资源、天气、更新提示、新手流程和核心文件格子流程均已适配。
- 统一文件格子、文件夹映射、自动叠放、格子组、托盘创建和移入回收站等产品表述。
- 首个文件格子默认从屏幕右侧打开，先解释收纳存储与文件夹映射的区别，并提示用户可从系统托盘新建格子。
- 修复从桌面粘贴到格子、向资源管理器复制或剪切多个选中文件，以及剪切完成后残留错误剪切样式的问题。

#### 稳定性与更新

- 开机启动、命令行兼容参数和用户主动打开共用一套启动判断。开机启动继续静默驻留托盘，主动打开保持交互式体验。
- 默认文件格子只会为真正的新用户创建一次；用户主动删除全部文件格子后不会被再次补回，设置恢复也不会意外创建新格子。
- 使用 Win+D 时动态格子仍保留在桌面；用户主动唤起时依然可以临时显示在其他应用上方。
- 卸载时可选择保留应用数据以便日后重新安装，或彻底删除设置、格子布局、随记、待办、缓存、日志、更新文件和恢复快照；配置的收纳路径内的真实文件始终保留。
- 修复安装、依赖下载、升级和卸载提示中的路径与数量占位符；新增的 6 种安装器语言也会在首次启动时向 DeskBox 传递对应语言。
- ARM64 更新会读取独立的安装包地址、SHA-256 和大小。
- 应用、应用包、x64 安装器和 ARM64 安装器版本统一为 1.3.8 / 1.3.8.0。

#### 多语言范围

- 新增语言优先覆盖文件格子、新手流程、天气和更新等主要体验；少量不常用的详细设置暂时回退英文，避免出现中文混杂。
- x64 和 ARM64 安装器现已提供与 DeskBox 相同的 11 种可选界面语言，依赖下载和卸载提示也会随语言切换。

## 1.3.7 - 2026-08-05

### English

#### Unified File Widgets and Groups

- **One shared file surface:** standalone file widgets and grouped file widgets now run through the same `FileSurfaceContent` and unified content host. The legacy standalone file interaction tree and XAML have been removed, eliminating a major source of behavior drift.
- **Group and standalone settings stay aligned:** list details, path display, compact list spacing, title styles, context menus, QuickLook, sorting, auto stacks, and cyclic Ctrl+Tab switching now follow the same implementation.
- **File operations are more complete:** newly created folders scroll into view and enter inline naming, new and existing folders can be renamed, files can be moved or copied into a folder item, and manual ordering is restored reliably after a cold start.
- **Native drag behavior is more predictable:** shortcut drag-out uses a Shell-compatible virtual-file path and reconciles a completed move, while reorder insertion indicators use a softer transition and no longer block dropping onto a folder.

#### Hotkeys, State, and Recovery

- **Repeated global toggles are serialized:** rapid tray or hotkey presses are processed through one state transaction, preventing widget windows from being stranded off-screen or the global hotkey from becoming unresponsive after several toggles.
- **Lifecycle recovery is broader:** display topology, DPI, sleep and resume, remote-session changes, and Explorer restarts share window-state recovery and diagnostics.
- **Settings survive shutdown more reliably:** pending file-order and configuration changes are flushed before exit, recoverable snapshots protect against damaged settings, and save failures are recorded instead of silently reverting to defaults.
- **Weather view preference persists:** the selected Day or Week forecast mode is restored after an application restart.

#### Search and Interface

- **Search returns useful work sooner:** providers publish staged incremental results and failures are isolated so one unavailable source does not block the remaining search pipeline.
- **Selection and tables are clearer:** Ctrl/Shift multi-selection, rubber-band selection with edge auto-scroll, result rows, sortable columns, and header hover states have been refined for predictable batch work.
- **Windows-native visual states:** file hover and selection use theme-adaptive neutral colors with tighter corners; destructive Close actions use one softer red treatment across widgets, and file context menus have a consistent order.
- **Settings and support polish:** About uses space more efficiently, the unnecessary repository button was removed, a feedback email card was added, and diagnostics can be exported as a privacy-filtered package.

#### Installation and Updates

- **Upgrades keep one DeskBox installation:** stable installer identity and existing-path detection reuse and lock the current install directory, preventing a normal upgrade from creating a second copy.
- **The update handoff is visible:** after DeskBox closes, the downloaded installer opens normally so the user can see progress without choosing the installation path again.
- **Download failures are actionable:** the updater offers retry and official-site fallback, while long release notes open in a dedicated view instead of being clipped above the progress bar.
- **Dual-architecture distribution:** framework-dependent x64 and ARM64 installers reuse compatible .NET 10 and Windows App Runtime 2.2 installations and download only a missing architecture-matched dependency.

### 中文

#### 文件格子与格子组统一

- **共用同一套文件内容**：独立文件格子与格子组内文件格子统一由 `FileSurfaceContent` 和内容宿主承载，旧独立文件交互树与 XAML 已删除，从架构上消除两套实现逐渐不一致的问题。
- **组内与独立设置保持一致**：列表详细信息、路径显示、紧凑间距、标题样式、右键菜单、QuickLook、排序、自动叠放和可循环 Ctrl+Tab 均走同一套实现。
- **文件操作更完整**：新建文件夹会自动滚动到可见位置并进入名称输入，新旧文件夹均可重命名，文件可以移动或复制到格子内的文件夹，冷启动后也能可靠恢复手动排序。
- **原生拖放更可控**：快捷方式拖出使用兼容 Shell 的虚拟文件路径，并在移动完成后同步源状态；排序插入提示过渡更柔和，也不会再挡住拖入文件夹的操作。

#### 快捷键、状态与恢复

- **连续唤起串行处理**：短时间连续点击托盘或按全局快捷键时，所有显隐操作进入同一个状态事务，避免格子丢失到屏幕外，或多次切换后全局热键暂时失效。
- **生命周期恢复覆盖更完整**：显示器拓扑、DPI、睡眠唤醒、远程会话和资源管理器重启共用窗口状态恢复与诊断。
- **退出保存更可靠**：退出前刷新待保存的文件顺序与配置；损坏设置可以从快照恢复；保存失败会记录和提示，不再静默恢复默认值。
- **天气视图会记忆**：天气格子选择的日视图或周视图会在应用重启后恢复。

#### 搜索与界面

- **搜索更快返回可用结果**：不同来源分阶段增量发布结果，并隔离单个来源异常，某个数据源不可用时不会阻塞其余搜索流程。
- **多选与表格更清晰**：补齐 Ctrl/Shift 多选、带边缘自动滚动的框选，并优化结果行、可排序列和表头悬停状态，批量操作更可预测。
- **更接近 Windows 原生视觉**：文件悬停与选中改为明暗自适应的中性色并缩小圆角；所有格子的“关闭”使用统一且更柔和的红色，文件右键菜单顺序保持一致。
- **设置与支持细节**：关于页减少无效空白，移除不需要的开源仓库按钮，新增反馈邮箱卡片，并可导出经过隐私过滤的一键诊断包。

#### 安装与更新

- **升级只保留一个 DeskBox**：稳定的安装器标识与已有路径检测会复用并锁定当前安装目录，普通升级不会再生成第二份应用。
- **更新交接过程可见**：DeskBox 关闭后正常打开已下载的安装器，用户可以看到安装进度，同时无需重新选择路径。
- **下载失败可处理**：更新器提供重试与官网回退；较长的版本日志改在独立界面打开，不再挤在进度条上方被截断。
- **双架构发布**：x64 和 ARM64 均为框架依赖安装包，复用兼容的 .NET 10 与 Windows App Runtime 2.2，只在缺少时下载对应架构依赖。

## 1.3.6 - 2026-08-04

### English

#### Widget Group Reliability and Interaction

- **Fast tab switching is recoverable:** Ctrl+Tab is now handled once per physical key gesture, with a short cooldown for rapid separate presses. Repeated key-down messages can no longer queue a switch storm or leave the keyboard path waiting for a manual tab click to recover.
- **Faster grouped file surfaces:** inactive group members retain a bounded, reusable content cache. Rapid tab changes no longer repeatedly dispose and recreate file grids, watchers, and icon work.
- **Correct group layering:** grouped widgets now keep the same temporary foreground state as standalone widgets at startup and across merge, detach, dissolve, and member-switch transitions.
- **QuickLook works inside groups:** Space reaches the selected file surface in a group and opens the same QuickLook preview behavior as a standalone file widget.

#### File Import and Visual Polish

- **Browser and WeChat drops are reliable:** virtual browser files preserve their resolved extension when copied into a standalone widget, and the native drop bridge lets WeChat and other non-WinUI sources import into grouped file widgets.
- **Initial icon hydration is consistent:** grouped file surfaces no longer cancel their first background refresh merely because their desktop window is shown without activation. Placeholder icons are temporary, square rounded cards with a softer appearance.
- **Capsule and content transitions are smoother:** compact expansion warm-up follows the actual incoming group content, while expensive surface work is deferred during geometry transitions.

#### Desktop Organization and Release

- **Organization targets are clearer:** the preview reports the actual existing widget destination rather than misleadingly showing a new target, and placement can keep working when the visible desktop is crowded or widgets are hidden.
- **Framework-dependent installers:** x64 and ARM64 installers remain small and check the matching .NET 10 Runtime and Windows App Runtime 2.2. Missing dependencies are downloaded only when needed.

### 中文

#### 格子组可靠性与交互

- **高频 Tab 切换可恢复**：Ctrl+Tab 现在按一次物理按键手势只处理一次，并对连续独立按键做短暂冷却。重复 KeyDown 不会再堆积切换事务，也不会出现必须手动点一次 Tab 才能恢复的问题。
- **格子组文件页切换更快**：非活动成员会保留有容量上限、可复用的内容缓存；频繁切换时不再反复销毁和重建文件网格、监听器与图标加载。
- **格子组层级正确**：启动以及合并、拆分、解散、成员切换期间，格子组会与独立格子保持一致的临时前景层级。
- **组内空格预览生效**：空格可以传递到格子组内选中的文件区域，调用与独立文件格子相同的 QuickLook 预览行为。

#### 文件导入与视觉细节

- **浏览器和微信拖入更稳定**：浏览器虚拟文件复制到独立格子时会保留解析出的扩展名；微信等非 WinUI 拖放源也可以导入格子组内的文件格子。
- **首次图标加载一致**：格子组的文件页不会因桌面窗口以非激活方式显示而取消首次后台刷新。占位图标改为短暂展示的柔和正方形圆角卡片。
- **胶囊与内容切换更流畅**：胶囊展开预热会跟随实际切入的格子组内容，尺寸过渡期间会延后较重的表面工作。

#### 桌面整理与发布

- **整理目标更清晰**：预览会展示实际命中的已有格子，而不会误显示为新建目标；可见桌面拥挤或格子隐藏时也会继续寻找合适位置完成整理。
- **框架依赖安装包**：x64 与 ARM64 安装包继续保持轻量，按架构检测 .NET 10 Runtime 和 Windows App Runtime 2.2，仅在缺少时联网下载。

## 1.3.5 - 2026-08-03

> Scope note: Desktop organization, automatic organization, and widget groups were not part of 1.3.4. They are new in 1.3.5; the 1.3.4 section below remains the historical release record.

### English

#### New in 1.3.5

- **Desktop organization (new):** A responsive card preview shows the files to move, the selected destination, the items that stay on the Desktop, and the final storage location before anything runs.
- **Desktop organization controls (new):** Each card has its own organize checkbox and target selector, with readable icon previews, a destination explanation, a non-moving-items panel, and responsive window sizing.
- **Automatic organization (new):** Growing downloads, temporary/archive work, extraction, and same-path replacements wait for a stable terminal state; 100 MB is the large-file threshold and incomplete baselines are never committed.
- **Widget groups (new):** File widgets can be merged, scrolled with the title wheel, detached by dragging the title, dissolved, and normalized to the group’s standard or compact presentation with consistent z-order.
- **File dragging and sorting:** Cross-screen reorder uses a breathing insertion line and commits once on drop; standalone and grouped surfaces share the same virtualization-safe insertion calculation.
- **Folder widget synchronization:** Structured enumeration distinguishes empty, partial, unavailable, and access-denied folders; offline snapshots stay visible, refreshes preserve manual order, and watcher generations isolate stale mappings.
- **Search and USN reliability:** Root manifests, partial-scan protection, subtree cleanup, watcher recovery, and incremental USN create/delete/rename/hard-link updates prevent valid results from disappearing during outages or journal gaps.
- **Path and merge safety:** Junction, symlink, SUBST, UNC-alias, nested-mapping, merge, dissolve, and save-failure paths receive real-identity checks and rollback protection.
- **Windows compatibility and recovery:** Backdrop fallback, reduced-motion/high-contrast handling, sleep/unlock/RDP recovery, Explorer restart checks, display recovery, and startup z-order normalization improve Windows 10 and Windows 11 behavior.
- **Release notes, diagnostics, and localization:** Settings opens the latest bilingual Markdown notes in a separate window; watcher/index health is visible; five language resources and reliability tests are synchronized.

### 中文

## 1.3.4 - 2026-07-29

### English

#### Resource Lifecycle and Memory

- **Feature widgets now release their UI**: Disabling Todo, Quick Capture, Music, Weather, or Search closes the corresponding window and releases its content, view model, subscriptions, timers, and feature-owned services while preserving saved data.
- **Settings closes instead of hiding**: Closing Settings now destroys the window and releases its WinUI visual tree. Reopening Settings creates a fresh window.
- **Transient timer ownership fixed**: One-shot capsule timers now detach their handlers when they fire or are cancelled, and music timers, storyboards, and event subscriptions stop with their owning view instead of remaining rooted for the process lifetime.
- **Guarded idle maintenance**: DeskBox can compact managed/native heaps and trim resident pages after full background inactivity. A separate threshold-based maintenance pass can also run while widgets remain visible but DeskBox is not being used; foreground, pointer, resize, search, indexing, and other active work suppress collection.
- **Bounded caches**: File icons, decoded bitmaps, and metadata caches now have count and estimated-memory limits, with diagnostics for verifying their size.

#### Search Responsiveness and Index Residency

- **Search follows its feature switch**: Heavy search services are not initialized at startup when Search is disabled. Turning Search off releases its popup, hotkey registration, custom/USN indexes, history/action services, file metadata service, and icon cache.
- **Popup shell warm-up**: When Search is enabled, DeskBox prepares the empty popup shell during a low-priority idle slice so a desktop-widget click does not have to construct the full WinUI window first.
- **Open-only widget action**: Repeated search-widget clicks now open or refocus the popup and can no longer toggle it closed while queued pointer events are still arriving.
- **Window-first loading**: The native popup is shown and focused before recommendations, result icons, or an idle-unloaded index do work. Index restoration starts when the popup is invoked, not after the user types.
- **Idle index unload**: After five minutes without Search, the large resident custom index is saved and released while lightweight file-system watchers remain active. Changes are collected in a small delta map and reconciled when the popup restores the index.
- **Lower-cost indexing and ranking**: Persisted indexes are streamed instead of building a second full JSON copy; directory strings are pooled; stale scans are cancellable; fresh indexes can be reused; and searches retain only the highest-ranked candidates.
- **Visible result fallbacks**: File and folder results without a decoded Shell icon now display an appropriate fallback glyph instead of an empty icon column.

#### Capsule Mode and Window Layering

- **Idle expansion warm-up**: Collapsed widgets pre-measure their expanded layout during an idle UI slice, reducing the first hover expansion hitch without visibly opening every capsule.
- **First-hover recovery**: Smart hover expansion reads the native cursor position after startup, tray restore, and wake, so a capsule no longer needs an activating click before hover works.
- **No hover-through between capsules**: Smart expansion verifies the native pointer root window before opening. Moving inside an expanded widget can no longer trigger an overlapping collapsed capsule underneath it or let that capsule steal the foreground layer.
- **Foreground-safe hover expansion**: If a capsule is still physically above the desktop after a temporary tray/F7 raise has ended, hover expansion reorders it only among DeskBox windows and keeps the current external application in front.
- **Immediate title-bar collapse**: In click-to-toggle mode, clicking the expanded title bar collapses the widget on the next UI turn without the previous fixed 420 ms delay. Other expansion modes are unchanged.

#### Weather Redesign

- **Responsive information hierarchy**: Mini, compact, and expanded layouts were rebuilt around current conditions, compact metrics, hourly forecast, sunrise/sunset, and a scrollable Week view.
- **Standard and Rich skins**: Standard follows the selected app theme and capsule surface; Rich uses condition-aware gradients and matching compact presentation. Rich is now the default for new users and after reset.
- **Contrast across conditions**: Rich-skin text is selected from the weather backdrop rather than blindly following app light/dark mode, while interaction indicators and daylight details use palettes tuned separately for Standard and Rich surfaces.
- **Cleaner native selection**: Day/Week and current-hour selection use a small system-style bottom indicator without changing label weight or color, and labels no longer clip at compact heights.
- **Compact sunrise arc**: The previous tall divider was replaced by a lower sunrise/sunset arc with a daylight progress marker.
- **Reduced continuous effects**: Decorative perpetual weather animations were removed. Only short, state-driven feedback such as the active refresh rotation remains.
- **Forecast and symbol fixes**: Restored the multi-day forecast in the largest single-day layout and replaced the boxed fog emoji with a compatible cloud symbol.
- **Late-day hourly continuity**: MSN forecasts now continue into following days when the current day has no remaining hourly rows.
- **Reliable city selection**: City search ignores spacing, punctuation, and diacritics, ranks exact text matches before proximity, validates coordinates, and queues a fresh request when the previous city's refresh is still running.

#### Music Stability and Efficiency

- **Stable track handoff**: Bursts of media-property events are settled and generation-checked before display, keeping the previous complete track visible until the next complete title and artist are available.
- **Transient empty-state protection**: Brief empty metadata returned while changing tracks is retried instead of clearing the capsule and rebuilding its text several times.
- **Cover work is deduplicated**: Covers reload only when the session/track signature changes, decode at a bounded size, and discard stale asynchronous results.
- **Inactive animation work stops**: Title marquee and record rotation stop while the widget is hidden or collapsed and are restarted only when the expanded surface is visible. The marquee no longer leaves a flashing trailing clone while paused.
- **Lower-cost progress updates**: Expanded, collapsed, hidden, and non-seekable states use different refresh behavior instead of running the full timeline path continuously.
- **Control sizing polish**: Play is slightly larger in Controls, Record vertical, and Record horizontal layouts; previous/next, playback mode, and volume use a smaller consistent secondary size.
- **Empty-cover corners**: Fixed the soft upper corners around the empty album-art surface in Controls mode.

#### File Icons and Launching

- **Sharper large icons**: Executables and shortcuts request higher-resolution Windows Shell icon sources, fixing visibly blurred enlarged icons for apps such as packaged or custom launchers.
- **Cleaner small icons**: High-quality downsampling reduces the jagged look that appeared after improving large icon extraction.
- **Stack icon scaling**: Icons inside automatic stacks now follow the configured file-icon size.
- **Bounded thumbnail memory**: Decoded icon and thumbnail data is evicted by both item count and estimated bytes.
- **Shortcut launch compatibility**: `.lnk` files use the Windows Shell execution path, avoiding direct-resolution failures and reducing shortcut-specific crashes or long stalls.

#### Widgets and Context Menus

- **Blank-area menus**: Todo and Quick Capture blank content areas now expose the same widget menu as their title bars.
- **File-widget menu completion**: The file content menu includes Title style and Expansion mode, positioned below Auto stack and above Sort by.
- **Conditional Paste**: Paste is omitted when the clipboard does not contain content that the file widget can accept, instead of showing a disabled command.
- **Close from file content**: File and mapped-folder content menus now include the same Close widget command and second-step confirmation used by the title-bar menu, positioned above Refresh.

#### Hotkeys and Product Cleanup

- **Removed low-level keyboard hooks**: Global and Search hotkeys now use standard `RegisterHotKey`/`WM_HOTKEY` handling, avoiding intercepted D-key input, repeats, and latency.
- **RDP modifier recovery**: Modifier key-up recovery prevents Alt/Ctrl/Shift from remaining logically pressed after a Remote Desktop hotkey.
- **Correct Search hotkey lifecycle**: The Search hotkey switch refreshes registration correctly and cannot open Search while the Search widget feature is disabled.
- **Simplified hotkey settings**: Global and Search hotkeys share the top-level Shortcuts & Interaction page in compact expandable cards.
- **Opt-in first-run behavior**: New installations and reset defaults keep capsule mode and the global Search hotkey off until the user enables them.
- **Search widget title default**: Newly created Search widgets use floating title chrome by default, matching Weather and Music.
- **Image widget removed**: The legacy image-gallery widget and its associated services, settings, models, and views were removed.

#### Distribution

- **Version 1.3.4**: Application, file, assembly, MSIX, and installer versions are aligned to 1.3.4.
- **x64 and ARM64 installers**: Both packages are framework-dependent. Setup checks the matching .NET 10 Runtime and Windows App Runtime 2.2 architecture and downloads only a missing dependency.

### 中文

#### 资源生命周期与内存

- **功能格子关闭后释放界面**：关闭待办、随记、音乐、天气或搜索功能时，会关闭对应窗口并释放内容、ViewModel、订阅、定时器和功能专属服务，同时保留已保存数据。
- **设置窗口真正关闭**：关闭设置页时不再只隐藏窗口，而是销毁窗口并释放 WinUI 视觉树；下次打开时重新创建。
- **临时定时器正确释放**：胶囊一次性定时器在触发或取消时会解绑事件；音乐定时器、Storyboard 与订阅跟随所属视图停止，不再被意外保留到进程结束。
- **受保护的空闲整理**：应用完全进入后台后可整理托管堆、原生堆与工作集；即使格子仍显示，只要 DeskBox 未被操作且达到资源阈值，也可执行另一组保守维护。前台、鼠标、缩放、搜索、索引等活动会阻止回收。
- **缓存增加上限**：文件图标、解码位图和元数据缓存同时受条目数与估算内存限制，并增加可观测诊断数据。

#### 搜索响应与索引常驻

- **搜索资源与功能开关联动**：搜索未开启时，启动阶段不初始化重型搜索服务；关闭搜索会释放弹窗、快捷键注册、自定义/USN 索引、历史与操作服务、文件元数据服务和图标缓存。
- **空闲预热弹窗外壳**：搜索开启后，DeskBox 会在低优先级空闲切片中准备空弹窗，点击桌面搜索格子时无需先构造完整 WinUI 窗口。
- **搜索格子只负责打开**：连续点击搜索格子只会打开或重新聚焦弹窗，不会因为排队到达的指针事件把刚打开的窗口再次关闭。
- **窗口优先显示**：先显示并聚焦原生弹窗，再加载推荐内容、结果图标和已卸载索引；索引恢复在弹窗唤起时开始，不再等到用户输入文字。
- **索引空闲卸载**：搜索连续五分钟未使用时，保存并释放常驻的大型自定义索引，但保留轻量文件监听；期间变化进入小型增量表，下次弹窗恢复索引时再合并。
- **降低索引与排序成本**：索引改为流式写入，避免构造第二份完整 JSON；复用目录字符串；过期扫描可取消；可复用新鲜索引；搜索只保留最高排名候选。
- **结果图标占位修复**：无法解码 Shell 图标的文件和文件夹会显示对应的后备图标，不再留下空白图标列。

#### 胶囊模式与窗口层级

- **空闲预热展开布局**：收起的格子会在 UI 空闲切片中预先测量展开布局，改善第一次悬停展开的卡顿，不会在桌面上逐个可见展开。
- **首次悬停恢复**：应用启动、托盘恢复或唤醒后通过原生光标位置同步悬停状态，胶囊无需先点击即可自动展开。
- **相邻胶囊不再穿透误触**：智能展开前会核对原生指针所属窗口；在已展开格子内操作时，不会触发其下方重叠的收起胶囊，也不会让下方胶囊抢占前台层级。
- **悬停展开不越过前台应用**：托盘/F7 临时唤起结束后，如果胶囊仍在桌面上方，悬停展开只调整 DeskBox 格子之间的顺序，不会盖住当前外部前台应用。
- **标题栏立即收起**：点击切换模式下，点击展开格子的标题栏会在下一个 UI 调度立即收起，移除原来的固定 420 ms 延迟；其他展开模式不变。

#### 天气视觉重构

- **重建响应式信息层级**：迷你、紧凑和展开布局围绕当前天气、紧凑指标、逐小时预报、日出日落与可滚动周视图重新组织。
- **标准与高级皮肤**：标准皮肤跟随应用主题和标准胶囊表面；高级皮肤使用随天气变化的渐变，并同步高级胶囊样式。新用户与恢复默认后使用高级皮肤。

- **收紧日出日落圆弧**：用更低的日照进度圆弧替换原先偏高的分隔视觉，并增加日照位置标记。
- **降低持续动效开销**：移除持续运行的装饰性天气动效，仅保留刷新中旋转等短时、状态驱动反馈。
- **预报与符号修复**：恢复最大单日布局中的多日预报，并用兼容性更好的云符号替换会显示成白块的雾 Emoji。
- **跨日小时预报连续显示**：MSN 当天已没有小时数据时，会继续读取后续预报日，避免日视图下方留白。
- **城市选择更可靠**：城市搜索忽略空格、标点和重音符号，精确文本优先于距离排序；同时校验坐标，并在旧城市刷新仍运行时排队刷新新城市。

#### 音乐稳定性与效率

- **切歌信息稳定交接**：媒体属性事件集中到达时先等待稳定并核对代次，在下一首完整歌曲名与歌手名可用前保留上一首完整内容。
- **保护瞬时空数据**：切歌时播放器短暂返回空信息会先重试，不再立刻清空胶囊并让文字重复重排。
- **封面工作去重**：只有媒体会话/歌曲签名变化时才重新加载封面；限制解码尺寸，并丢弃已经过期的异步结果。
- **非活跃时停止动画**：音乐格子隐藏或收起后停止跑马灯和唱片旋转，只在展开表面可见时恢复；暂停后跑马灯尾部副本也不再闪烁。
- **降低进度刷新成本**：展开、收起、隐藏和不可拖动状态使用不同刷新策略，不再持续执行完整时间轴刷新。

- **缩略图内存有界**：图标和缩略图解码数据会按条目数与估算字节数淘汰。
- **快捷方式兼容启动**：`.lnk` 使用 Windows Shell 路径打开，避免直接解析启动带来的失败，并降低快捷方式特有的崩溃或长时间等待。

#### 格子与右键菜单

- **空白区域菜单**：待办和随记的空白内容区域现在显示与标题栏一致的格子菜单。
- **补全文件格子菜单**：文件内容区域新增“标题样式”和“展开方式”，位于“自动叠放”下方、“排序方式”上方。
- **按需显示粘贴**：剪贴板没有文件格子可接受的内容时，直接隐藏“粘贴”，不再显示置灰项。
- **内容区域可关闭格子**：文件格子和映射文件夹格子的内容菜单在“刷新”上方加入“关闭格子”，并保留与标题栏一致的二级确认。

#### 热键与功能精简

- **移除低级键盘钩子**：全局与搜索热键改为标准 `RegisterHotKey`/`WM_HOTKEY`，避免 D 键被拦截、重复输入和延迟。
- **远程桌面修饰键恢复**：热键触发后补充修饰键释放，避免 RDP 环境下 Alt/Ctrl/Shift 保持按下状态。

## 1.3.3 - 2026-07-24

### English

#### Drag & Drop Enhancements

- **WeChat file drag-drop**: Drag files and images directly from WeChat chat windows into grid items. A background polling thread reliably detects mouse release during OLE drags, bypassing WinUI 3's unreliable Drop event for non-Chromium drag sources.
- **Browser URL drag-drop**: Dragging images or file links from browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) now downloads the URL to a temporary file and imports it automatically.
- **Folder drop support**: Files dragged onto a folder item within a grid are transferred into that folder.
- **Virtual file fix**: NativeDropTarget now tries `TYMED_ISTREAM` and `TYMED_HGLOBAL` separately for `FileContents`, fixing silent failures on browser virtual file drops.

#### Stack Group Management

- **Rename stacks**: Right-click a stack group header to rename it with an inline text box. Custom names persist across restarts.
- **Reorder stacks**: Move stack groups up or down via the right-click context menu.
- **Disable/restore stacks**: "Don't stack this group" dissolves a stack so its members display as loose items. Disabled groups can be restored from the same menu.

#### Weather Data Source

- **MSN Weather (default)**: Added MSN Weather API as the default data source — the same source used by the Windows weather widget. Provides current conditions, hourly and daily forecasts, sunrise/sunset, and UV index.
- **Open-Meteo fallback**: If the primary source fails, the app automatically falls back to Open-Meteo. Users can also manually select the data source in Settings → Weather.
- **Weather code mapping**: Added reverse mapping from MSN weather description text to WMO codes, so MSN-sourced data reuses the existing emoji/glyph/animation system.

#### F7 Z-Order Reliability Fix

- **Silent restore fix**: `ClearTopMostPreservingForeground` now unconditionally calls `BringWindowToFront(foreground)` instead of gating on `wasTopMost`. Previously, raised widgets used temporary TopMost (TOPMOST→NOTOPMOST), so the gate was always false — the restore state changed but the visual didn't, causing "flicker without collapse" on the next F7 press.
- **Cross-process click detection**: Replaced unreliable low-bit `GetAsyncKeyState` with a 50ms high-bit mouse sampler that detects up→down edges globally. The 200ms restore monitor now consumes an `_outsideMousePressObserved` flag, reliably detecting clicks on foreign windows — including clicks on an already-activated window.
- **Drag poll interference fix**: Reduced the drag-drop background polling timeout from 30s to 5s to minimize interference with `GetAsyncKeyState` low-bit consumption.

#### Search Widget Refinements

- **Clear history button**: Added a clear button in the search widget footer to wipe recent queries and result cards while preserving pinned favorites.
- **Live sync**: The search widget now auto-refreshes when search history changes in the popup.
- **Removed auto-generated recommendations**: The widget body shows only items the user actually opened. Auto-generated Start Menu app shortcuts are no longer shown in the widget body.
- **Simplified placeholder**: Search placeholder changed to "Search files..." for clarity.

#### UI / UX Polish

- **Tray icon label fix**: The "Black" and "White" tray icon labels were swapped — now correctly labeled.
- **Collapsed preview chevron**: Hidden the chevron icon in collapsed stack preview mode for a cleaner look.
- **Search popup**: Removed the "Recommended apps" section header; minor padding adjustment.

#### Localization

- Added new strings for weather data source, stack management, and search clear button across all five supported languages (zh-CN, en-US, ja-JP, de-DE, pt-BR).
- Fixed tray icon color labels in all languages.

### 中文

#### 拖拽增强

- **微信文件拖拽**：可直接从微信聊天窗口拖拽文件和图片到格子内。后台轮询线程可靠检测 OLE 拖拽时的鼠标释放，绕过 WinUI 3 对非 Chromium 拖拽源 Drop 事件不可靠的问题。
- **浏览器链接拖拽**：从浏览器拖拽图片或文件链接时，自动下载 URL 到临时文件并导入。
- **文件夹投放支持**：拖拽文件到格子内的文件夹项目上时，文件会直接传输到该文件夹中。
- **虚拟文件修复**：NativeDropTarget 现在分别尝试 `TYMED_ISTREAM` 和 `TYMED_HGLOBAL` 获取 `FileContents`，修复浏览器虚拟文件拖拽静默失败的问题。

#### 叠放组管理

- **重命名叠放组**：右键叠放组标题可使用内联文本框重命名，自定义名称跨重启保存。
- **叠放组排序**：通过右键菜单上移/下移叠放组。
- **取消/恢复折叠**：可选择"不再折叠此分组"，将叠放组成员显示为散列项目。已取消的分组可从同一菜单恢复。

#### 天气数据源

- **MSN 天气（默认）**：新增 MSN 天气 API 作为默认数据源，与 Windows 天气小组件同源。提供实时天气、逐小时和逐日预报、日出日落和 UV 指数。
- **Open-Meteo 备用源**：主源请求失败时自动切换到 Open-Meteo。用户也可在设置 → 天气中手动选择数据源。
- **天气代码映射**：新增 MSN 天气描述文本到 WMO 代码的反向映射，使 MSN 数据源可复用现有的 emoji/动画系统。

#### F7 层级可靠性修复

- **静默回落修复**：`ClearTopMostPreservingForeground` 现在无条件调用 `BringWindowToFront(foreground)`，不再以 `wasTopMost` 门控。此前唤起的格子使用瞬态置顶，门控恒为 false —— 回落状态变了但画面没变，导致下次按 F7 时"闪烁不收起"。
- **跨进程点击检测**：用 50ms 高位 `GetAsyncKeyState` 采样器（全局物理状态 + up→down 边沿检测）替代不可靠的低位检测。200ms 回落监视器现在消费采样器设置的 `_outsideMousePressObserved` 标志，可靠检测对外部窗口的点击 —— 包括点击已激活窗口这种 Windows 不做 Z-order 变化的情况。
- **拖拽轮询干扰修复**：拖拽后台轮询超时从 30s 缩短到 5s，减少对 `GetAsyncKeyState` 低位消费的干扰。

#### 搜索格子改进

- **清空历史按钮**：搜索格子底部新增清空按钮，可清除最近搜索和结果卡片，保留收藏项。
- **实时同步**：搜索弹窗中历史变化时，搜索格子自动刷新。
- **移除自动推荐**：格子主体现在只显示用户实际打开过的项目。自动生成的开始菜单应用快捷方式不再显示在格子主体中。
- **简化占位符**：搜索占位符改为"搜索文件..."。

#### 界面/体验打磨

- **托盘图标标签修复**："黑色"和"白色"托盘图标标签此前是反的，现已修正。
- **折叠预览箭头**：折叠叠放组预览中隐藏了箭头图标，更简洁。
- **搜索弹窗**：移除"推荐应用"分区标题；微调内边距。

#### 本地化

- 在全部五种语言（zh-CN、en-US、ja-JP、de-DE、pt-BR）中新增天气数据源、叠放组管理和搜索清空按钮的翻译字符串。
- 修复全部语言中托盘图标颜色标签颠倒的问题。

## 1.3.2 - 2026-07-23

### English

#### Search System (New)

- **Full-text desktop search**: Added a complete search infrastructure with a dedicated search popup window, global hotkey activation, and instant result display. Supports searching files, folders, applications, and settings from a single entry point.
- **USN Journal indexing**: Added `UsnJournalIndexService` that reads the NTFS USN change journal for fast, low-overhead file discovery without walking the directory tree.
- **Windows Index integration**: Added `WindowsIndexSearchService` that queries the Windows Indexing Service for content-searchable results including document metadata.
- **Search result ranking**: Added `SearchResultRanker` with a weighted scoring algorithm considering name match position, file type priority, recency, and path depth.
- **Search history**: Added `SearchHistoryService` with recent-search persistence, quick re-execution, and history clearing.
- **Recommended apps panel**: The search popup shows a recommended-apps panel with keyboard navigation (arrow keys + Enter to launch, Space to preview via QuickLook).
- **Type sort and filter**: Search results can be sorted and filtered by type (files, folders, apps, settings).
- **Search widget content**: Added `SearchWidgetContent` and `SearchWidgetContentAdapter` so search can be embedded as a widget content type.
- **Search settings section**: Added a dedicated Search settings page with hotkey configuration, index scope, result count, and recommendation toggles.

#### Multi-Language Expansion

- **Three new languages**: Added Japanese (ja-JP), German (de-DE), and Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) localization with 1500+ translated strings each, covering all widgets, settings, onboarding, search, tray menus, dialogs, and status messages.
- **Localization architecture rewrite**: Replaced the legacy `.resw` resource system with a JSON-based `LocalizationService` that loads embedded `Strings/{locale}.json` files at runtime, enabling easier community translation contributions and hot-reload during development.

#### Onboarding Redesign

- **Five-step focused flow**: Rebuilt the first-run guide from the previous multi-panel layout into a focused five-step flow: Welcome, Feature Overview, Storage Setup, Hotkey Configuration, and Completion.
- **Refined layout and animations**: Each step uses purpose-built entrance animations, consistent spacing, and localized content in all five supported languages.

#### Adaptive Tray Animation System

- **Hardware-adaptive controller**: Added `AdaptiveTrayAnimationController` and `HardwareAdaptiveAnimationService` that detect GPU capability and adjust animation complexity accordingly — full composition animations on discrete GPUs, simplified fallbacks on integrated graphics.
- **Batch animation driver**: Added `WidgetTrayBatchAnimationDriver` for synchronized multi-widget tray show/hide, eliminating per-widget timing drift.
- **Smart animation adapter**: Added `SmartAnimationAdapter` that bridges the adaptive controller with existing widget animation paths.
- **Synchronized scheduling**: Replaced fire-and-forget `DispatcherQueue.TryEnqueue` calls with synchronized scheduling, reducing animation tearing on rapid tray toggles.

#### Weather Improvements

- **City database expansion**: Expanded the offline `cities.json` database from ~500 to 5000+ entries covering significantly more small and medium cities worldwide.
- **Improved city search**: `CitySearchService` now uses prefix + fuzzy matching with CJK-aware tokenization for better results in Chinese, Japanese, and other non-Latin scripts.
- **Location service refinement**: Improved `WindowsLocationHelper` with better timeout handling, fallback to last-known position, and clearer error reporting.
- **Weather layout improvements**: Refined `WeatherWidgetContent` layouts for all four size modes with better spacing, icon alignment, and forecast list scrolling.

#### Installer and Updater

- **ARM64 installer**: Added `DeskBox.arm64.iss` and `DeskBox.Dependencies.arm64.iss` for native ARM64 Windows builds.
- **Reliable process kill**: Installer now uses a robust process-termination sequence before overwrite, avoiding file-lock failures.
- **Force-update enforcement**: `AppUpdateService` now enforces mandatory updates when the server flags a version as critical.
- **Helper cleanup**: Stale update-helper directories under `%LocalAppData%\DeskBox\update-helper` are cleaned up automatically.
- **Official download URLs**: Switched all download links to the official GitHub Releases channel.
- **Migration support**: Added `DeskBox.Migration.iss` for handling data migration during major version upgrades.
- **English installer language**: Added `Languages/English.isl` for proper English installer UI on non-Chinese systems.
- **Installer language selection**: The installer now shows a language-selection dialog (Chinese, English, Japanese, German, Brazilian Portuguese) pre-selected to the system locale. The chosen language is written to `HKCU\Software\DeskBox\InstallLanguage`, and DeskBox uses it as the default app language on first run (a manual in-app change still wins).
- **Search popup polish**: The result-list header now aligns with the data rows; the sort header carries a subtle background and shares the menu-bar margins.
- **Weather capsule fix**: Removed a duplicate title icon so capsule mode shows only the weather emoji.
- **Capsule hover mask**: Hidden the semi-transparent right-edge hover mask in capsule mode (interaction unchanged).

#### Architecture and Maintainability

- **App.Tray extraction**: Extracted `App.Tray.cs` (704 lines) from `App.xaml.cs`, consolidating all tray icon, menu, and lifecycle logic.
- **ServiceRegistry**: Added `ServiceRegistry` for centralized service location, reducing constructor parameter explosion.
- **SettingsMigrationService**: Added `SettingsMigrationService` for versioned settings schema migrations.
- **FileMetaService**: Added `FileMetaService` (332 lines) for unified file metadata extraction (icon, type name, size formatting).
- **AppDiagnosticsService**: Added `AppDiagnosticsService` for runtime diagnostics including handle counts, memory pressure, and UI thread responsiveness.
- **User guide**: Added a 10-chapter user guide under `docs/user-guide/` covering getting started, file widgets, todo, quick capture, capsule mode, stacks & QuickLook, appearance, backup, advanced workflows, and troubleshooting.

#### Fixes

- **QuickLook compatibility (critical)**: Fixed a critical issue where DeskBox could crash QuickLook's single-threaded named-pipe server by connecting without sending data (pipe probe in `CanPreview` and raw `CreateFile` fallback). Availability checks now use process enumeration only; the pipe is touched exclusively when sending a Toggle message.
- **Wallpaper loss**: Prevented desktop wallpaper loss caused by repeated `WorkerW` window spawns during widget layer operations in `WidgetLayerService`.
- **Capsule mode defaults**: Aligned `AppSettings` initial values with `ApplyDefaultPreferences` so new installs and global reset produce identical capsule behavior.
- **Tray menu height**: Fixed tray right-click menu height display issue.
- **Dead shortcut cleanup**: Added detection and removal of invalid `.lnk` and `.url` shortcuts (e.g. uninstalled Steam games) that previously showed broken icons in file widgets.
- **Weather code mapping**: Expanded `WeatherCodeMapper` with additional WMO weather codes for more accurate condition descriptions.

## 1.3.1 - 2026-07-20

### English

- **High-DPI icon clarity**: Replaced 32×32 `SHGFI_LARGEICON` extraction with `SHGetImageList` Jumbo (256×256) and Extra Large (48×48) fallback, plus `SHDefExtractIcon` for indexed icons. File and shortcut icons now match desktop icon clarity on high-DPI displays.
- **Steam shortcut icons**: Resolved `.url` shortcut icons not displaying by parsing comma-separated icon indices (e.g. `steam.exe,0`), searching for Steam via registry, and falling back to common install locations and system PATH.
- **Animation performance**: Replaced CPU-driven opacity/scale animations with GPU Composition KeyFrame animations. Added `DWMWA_TRANSITIONS_FORCEDISABLED` to prevent DWM interference. Replaced `AppWindow.Move` with direct `SetWindowPos` P/Invoke for lower latency.
- **Black screen transition fix**: Removed backdrop suppression during tray show/hide animations so Mica/Acrylic material remains consistent throughout the animation cycle.
- **Music artwork corner radius**: Fixed asymmetric corner radius on music widget album art in both empty and populated states by dynamically computing `CornerRadius` from widget settings.
- **Duplicate startup entries**: Unified startup registration to a single registry `Run` key. Removed redundant startup shortcut creation from the installer and drag-drop permission service. Added automatic cleanup of legacy startup shortcuts.
- **Capsule mode defaults**: New installs and global reset now default to hover auto-expand, sensitive hover response, and relaxed expand/collapse animation for a smoother first-run experience.
- **Freeze diagnostics**: Added a UI thread watchdog that detects and logs unresponsive periods with handle counts and GC generation. Fixed a sync-over-async deadlock in `StoreStartupService.RequestEnableAsync`.
- **Manual sort improvement**: Any drag-and-drop action in a file widget now automatically switches to manual sort mode. Subsequent sort mode clicks revert to automatic sorting. Removed the explicit "Manual Sort" menu option.

### 中文

- **高 DPI 图标清晰度**：将 32×32 的 `SHGFI_LARGEICON` 提取替换为 `SHGetImageList` Jumbo（256×256）和 Extra Large（48×48）回退，以及 `SHDefExtractIcon` 索引图标提取。文件和快捷方式图标在高 DPI 显示器上现在与桌面图标一样清晰。
- **Steam 快捷方式图标**：修复 `.url` 快捷方式图标不显示的问题，解析逗号分隔的图标索引（如 `steam.exe,0`），通过注册表搜索 Steam 安装路径，并回退到常见安装位置和系统 PATH。
- **动画性能**：将 CPU 驱动的透明度/缩放动画替换为 GPU Composition KeyFrame 动画。添加 `DWMWA_TRANSITIONS_FORCEDISABLED` 防止 DWM 干扰。将 `AppWindow.Move` 替换为直接 `SetWindowPos` P/Invoke 调用，降低延迟。
- **黑屏过渡修复**：移除托盘显示/隐藏动画期间的材质抑制，使 Mica/Acrylic 材质在整个动画周期内保持一致。
- **音乐封面圆角**：修复音乐格子封面在空状态和有值时圆角上下不对称的问题，通过动态计算 `CornerRadius` 解决。
- **重复启动项**：统一开机启动注册为单一注册表 `Run` 键。移除安装器和拖拽权限服务中多余的启动快捷方式创建。新增旧启动快捷方式自动清理。
- **胶囊模式默认值**：新安装和全局重置现在默认使用悬停自动展开、灵敏悬停响应和舒缓的展开/收起动画，提供更流畅的首次使用体验。
- **卡死诊断**：新增 UI 线程看门狗，检测并记录无响应时段的句柄数和 GC 代数。修复 `StoreStartupService.RequestEnableAsync` 中的 sync-over-async 死锁。
- **手动排序改进**：文件格子中任意拖拽操作现在自动切换到手动排序模式。后续排序模式点击恢复为自动排序。移除了显式的"手动排序"菜单选项。

## 1.3.0 - 2026-07-18

### English

- **Capsule mode**: Widgets can now collapse into compact desktop surfaces and expand by click or title-area hover. Compact content supports smart highlights, summaries or icon-and-title only, with an optional privacy mode for Todo and Quick Capture text.
- **Stable compact geometry**: Added aligned and independent width modes, anchored expansion toward the available screen area, separate compact and expanded bounds, resize guides, and per-widget overrides. Dragging content over a compact widget temporarily expands it without permanently moving or resizing either state.
- **Combined capsule layouts**: Compact widgets can remain independently positioned or form a movable combined bar. The bar supports user-defined order, floating or edge placement, automatic direction, adjustable spacing, and reliable restoration of free-layout positions.
- **Automatic file stacks**: File widgets can group related items by type or date without moving the underlying files. Custom extension rules support names, priority ordering, live match previews, thresholds, internal sorting and a configurable unmatched-file policy.
- **Stack interaction and QuickLook compatibility**: Stacks use an in-widget spread/collapse interaction with selection and path-copy commands. When QuickLook is already running, pressing Space on a selected file forwards the preview request without adding settings, startup work or a hard dependency.
- **Todo and Quick Capture workflows**: Added multiple file attachments with link-or-copy storage, attachment-aware clipboard formatting, configurable tab visibility, drag-to-tab actions, new Todo views for Active, This week and This month, adjustable list preview lines, and configurable Enter/Ctrl+Enter save behavior.
- **Appearance and responsive content**: Added Mica Alt and Base acrylic, material intensity, neutral/accent/hidden border colors, compact/standard/relaxed/custom density presets, and forced Cover or Controls layouts for Music. Solid material now remains fully opaque.
- **Windows-style Settings redesign**: Reorganized crowded pages into focused detail pages, moved global search into the title area, improved search matching and result navigation, surfaced important choices directly on entry cards, and made per-page hierarchy and reset behavior more consistent.
- **Backup, restore and attachment health**: Added integrity-checked ZIP export/restore, automatic and pre-restore snapshots, staged restart-safe restore, resilient JSON recovery, and attachment health scans for missing linked files, missing managed files and orphaned managed attachments.
- **Window and animation reliability**: Refined show/hide transitions, detail-page transitions, title-bar collapse actions, hover hit regions, Z-order, multi-monitor bounds restoration, resize alignment and tray menu sizing. Rapid capsule and stack interactions now use guarded state transitions to reduce flicker and stuck intermediate states.
- **Installer upgrades**: The installer now closes a running DeskBox process reliably before replacing application files, avoiding the intermittent Retry / Ignore / Cancel prompt during overwrite installs.
- **Maintainability and tests**: Split the largest window, widget, settings, Todo, Quick Capture, Music and Weather classes into focused modules. Expanded regression coverage across attachments, backup safety, settings migration/search, compact bounds and privacy, stacks, animation and positioning.

### 中文

- **待办与随记工作流**：支持一条内容关联多个文件，可选择关联原路径或复制到 DeskBox；复制文本时会按中英文格式附带附件路径。新增标签页显示配置、拖到标签页直接改变状态、待办“进行中/本周/本月”视图、列表预览行数，以及 Enter 与 Ctrl+Enter 保存行为互换。
- **外观与自适应内容**：新增云母 Alt、标准亚克力、材质浓度、中性/主题色/无边框颜色，显示密度支持紧凑、标准、宽松和自定义。音乐可强制使用封面或控制布局，纯色材质固定保持完全不透明。
- **Windows 风格设置重构**：将拥挤页面拆为聚焦的三级页面，把全局搜索移入标题栏并改进匹配与结果跳转；三级入口卡片直接提供最重要的选项，页面层级、前置控制和重置语义更加一致。
- **备份、恢复与附件健康检查**：新增带完整性校验的 ZIP 导出/恢复、自动快照、恢复前快照、重启后安全应用恢复、JSON 损坏回退，以及缺失关联文件、缺失托管附件和孤立附件扫描。
- **窗口与动画稳定性**：优化全局显示/隐藏、详情页进出、标题栏收起操作、悬停命中区域、窗口层级、多显示器位置恢复、调整大小参考线和托盘菜单高度。快速操作胶囊与叠放时使用受控状态切换，减少闪烁和卡在中间状态的问题。
- **覆盖安装体验**：安装器现在会在替换应用文件前可靠关闭正在运行的 DeskBox，避免覆盖安装时偶发弹出“重试 / 忽略 / 取消”提示。
- **可维护性与测试**：拆分体积过大的窗口、格子、设置、待办、随记、音乐和天气类，并扩展附件、备份安全、设置迁移与搜索、胶囊边界与隐私、叠放、动画和窗口定位的回归测试。

## 1.2.9 - 2026-07-13

### English

- **Todo experience rebuilt**: Replaced the dense single-page workflow with a card-based task list and a dedicated full-widget detail view. The detail title is a resizable multiline field, metadata actions use a compact horizontal toolbar, and task cards display up to ten lines.
- **Todo scheduling and organization**: Added eight color markers and filters, due date, reminder, recurrence and attachment workflows, recurring-task history handling, and context-menu shortcuts. Reminder and recurrence stay disabled until a due date exists.
- **Todo selection and batch actions**: Added box selection and batch copy, delete, color, reminder, due-date and recurrence commands. Removed native ListView selection residue after opening or returning from details, including the add-task card focus state.
- **Quick Capture redesign**: Reworked notes into a spacious card list and body-only full-widget editor. Added paper/material styles, image add and replace actions, thumbnails, image-specific copy controls, pin state feedback, and optional creation-time display.
- **Quick Capture sorting and batch actions**: Added animated drag sorting for regular and pinned notes while preserving drag-out copy behavior. Added batch copy, delete, pin and paper commands, and fixed stale image previews after returning from details.
- **Responsive widgets**: Reduced the minimum widget size from 200 x 200 to 150 x 150. Refined Weather layouts for small and medium sizes. Music now switches to an artwork-first layout below 180 px, keeps controls and the title readable, centers artwork cropping, reuses title marquee behavior, and applies a slower nonblank artwork transition.
- **Music simplification**: Removed all spectrum/rhythm visuals, settings, ViewModel state and related code. Unified solid playback icons, button sizing and rounded-rectangle hover surfaces across minimal and medium layouts.
- **File and context-menu improvements**: Simplified the native-style vertical menu order, kept Open and Extract text from image, renamed the Explorer command to Open file location, removed Show more options, and placed Delete last. Added file multi-selection actions and ensured commands close their flyouts immediately.
- **Widget title editing**: Rename commands now enter a focused editor immediately. Double-clicking any widget title starts editing, while clicking the remaining title area commits and exits.
- **Dynamic Z-order fixes**: Reworked tray and hotkey activation so all widgets raise together without a one-second flash, repeated activation hides them consistently, and subsequent foreground changes are managed naturally by Windows. Clicking a title raises all widgets; clicking content raises the current widget.
- **Settings and reset behavior**: Global reset now preserves language, startup and feature-widget switches, resets Quick Capture creation-time visibility and resize snapping correctly, clears per-widget title-style overrides, and uses confirmation dialogs for destructive feature-widget resets. Feature-widget menu wording now represents enable/disable rather than deletion.
- **Default settings updated**: New installs and global reset use Comfortable density, Mica material, Thin border, Round corners, segmented Todo and Quick Capture tabs, and hidden Todo footer counts.
- **Performance and memory**: Reduced unrelated Todo refreshes caused by organizer history writes, suppressed redundant settings broadcasts for file operations, tightened cancellation-token and event cleanup, removed music spectrum allocation paths, and improved repeated language/material/theme change behavior.
- **Reliability fixes**: Fixed Quick Capture clearing removing the add-note entry, image-plus-text copy behavior, created-time visibility, image persistence between list and detail views, completed Todo checkmark contrast, overlapping Todo cards, feature-widget reset completeness, and several tray/hotkey layer edge cases.
- **Tests**: Expanded coverage for Todo recurrence, persistence and batch changes; Quick Capture image, ordering and reset behavior; settings defaults; organizer notification suppression; responsive Music layout; and Weather layout thresholds.

### 中文

- **音乐功能精简**：完整移除频谱/节奏视觉、设置、ViewModel 状态和相关代码。统一最小与中等布局的实心播放图标、按钮尺寸及圆角矩形悬浮背景。
- **文件与右键菜单**：恢复流畅的竖排菜单并重新整理顺序，保留“打开”和“提取图片文字”，资源管理器命令改为“打开文件路径”，删除“显示更多选项”，删除命令固定在底部。文件格子增加多选操作，菜单命令执行后立即关闭。
- **格子标题编辑**：点击重命名后立即聚焦编辑；所有格子支持双击标题进入编辑；点击标题剩余空白区域提交并退出。
- **动态层级修复**：重新整理托盘与快捷键唤起逻辑，确保全部格子同时前置、不再闪烁一秒后置底，再次触发可一致隐藏，之后的前后台层级交还 Windows 管理。点击标题唤起全部格子，点击内容只唤起当前格子。
- **设置与重置行为**：全局重置保留语言、开机启动和功能格子开关，正确重置随记创建时间显示与调整大小吸附，清除格子标题栏独立覆盖值。功能格子完整重置增加二次确认，标题菜单文案改为开关而非删除。
- **默认设置调整**：新安装与全局重置默认使用舒适密度、云母材质、细边框、大圆角、待办/随记分段按钮，并关闭待办底部数量。
- **性能与内存**：减少文件整理历史写入引起的无关待办刷新，文件操作不再广播多余设置变更，完善取消令牌和事件释放，删除音乐频谱分配路径，并优化反复切换语言、材质和明暗模式时的生命周期。
- **稳定性修复**：修复清空随记后添加入口消失、图文复制失败、创建时间开关不生效、列表与详情图片不同步、待办完成勾选对比度、待办内容偶发重叠、功能格子重置不完整，以及多项托盘/快捷键层级边界问题。
- **测试**：扩展待办重复与批量变更、随记图片/排序/重置、设置默认值、整理服务通知抑制、音乐响应式布局和天气布局阈值测试。

## 1.2.8 - 2026-07-11

### English

- **Weather widget**: Added a full-featured weather widget with four layout modes (Mini, Compact, Standard, Detailed), city search with offline `cities.json` database and Windows Location API, auto-location, hourly and weekly forecasts, sunrise/sunset times, UV index, precipitation probability, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, rich skin backgrounds, and configurable refresh interval. Standard view activates at 250×215 and above. Horizontal scrollbar and mouse wheel support for the hourly temperature list. Week forecast fills remaining space and is scrollable even on small widgets. Loading animation with rotating refresh icon and content hiding during refresh.
- **Resize snap guide**: Added `ResizeGuideOverlayService` that detects edge alignment (8px threshold) with other widgets and work area boundaries during widget resize, showing accent-colored highlight bars on matched edges. Integrated into `WidgetWindow`, `QuickCaptureWidgetWindow`, and `ContentWidgetWindow`.
- **Quick Capture fixes**: Widget reset now properly clears all internal data via `QuickCaptureService.ClearAsync()`. Fixed blank display on first tab switch — data now appears immediately instead of requiring multiple switches. Added `ScheduleTransitionSafetyFallback` to `PlayItemsViewTransition` for more reliable content transitions.
- **Settings defaults unified**: Default appearance changed to Mica material, Medium border, Round corners — consistent across new installs, reset-to-defaults, and `AppSettings` initial values. Global reset (`ApplyDefaultPreferences`) now restores `CustomAccentColor` to `#0078D4` and `FocusClickedWidgetOnRaise` to `false`. Todo widget single-widget reset now restores `TodoReminderEnabled` and `TodoDefaultReminderOffsetMinutes`. Weather widget single-widget reset now clears `WeatherLatitude` and `WeatherLongitude` to prevent inconsistent location behavior.
- **Widget title font size**: Content widget titles now dynamically compute `TitleTextSize` and `TitleIconSize` from user settings (`TextSize`/`IconSize`) instead of using fixed values. Added `RefreshMetrics()` method to update title metrics when settings change.
- **Memory leak fix**: `TodoWidgetViewModel` now implements `IDisposable`, and `TodoWidgetContentAdapter` properly disposes the ViewModel on widget disposal, preventing memory leaks.
- **Delete widget button**: Added delete widget option to the "more" menu for all widget types, not just file widgets. Fixed `ContentWidgetWindow` more flyout placement.
- **Settings UI expansion**: Added standalone material type selector (Mica / Acrylic / Solid) and border style selector (None / Thin / Medium) to the Appearance settings page.
- **Widget layer improvement**: Added `SetWindowToDesktopLevel` method in `WidgetLayerService` that pushes windows to desktop level without using `HWND_BOTTOM`, preventing widgets from being hidden by Win+D while staying at desktop level.
- **Localization simplification**: Shortened drag-and-drop diagnostics text across both Chinese and English for clearer, more concise messaging.
- **FolderWatcherService optimization**: Replaced `CancellationTokenSource`-based debounce with `DispatcherQueueTimer`, reducing thread-pool task creation for file system change notifications.
- **Code refactoring — WidgetWindowBase**: Extracted a new `WidgetWindowBase.cs` (1027 lines) consolidating window setup, backdrop management, layer/Z-order control, drag/resize logic, and display-change restoration. `ContentWidgetWindow` and `QuickCaptureWidgetWindow` now inherit from this shared base, eliminating duplicated window management code.
- **Code refactoring — WidgetWindow**: Split `WidgetWindow.xaml.cs` (~5000 lines) into 6 partial classes: `Rename` (335 lines), `Menus` (677), `ItemSurface` (364), `Clipboard` (249), `Selection` (397), `DragDrop` (806). Main file reduced to 2828 lines.
- **Code refactoring — WidgetManager**: Split `WidgetManager.cs` (3532 lines) into 4 partial classes: `WidgetManager.TrayAnimation.cs` (353 lines, tray show/hide animation), `WidgetManager.ZOrder.cs` (376 lines, Z-order/layer management/mouse hook), `WidgetManager.Storage.cs` (595 lines, managed storage/folder mapping/orphan cleanup), `WidgetManager.FeatureWidgets.cs` (889 lines, Music/Weather/Todo/QuickCapture feature widgets). Core file reduced to 1383 lines.
- **Log rotation**: Added `TryRotateLogFileIfNeeded` with a 5MB size threshold — automatically backs up to `.bak` and cleans up old logs.
- **Atomic settings writes**: `SettingsService.SaveToFileOnlyAsync` now writes to a `.tmp` file first, then moves it to the final path, preventing configuration corruption from interrupted writes.
- **Onboarding redesign**: Simplified onboarding animation API and refined the first-run experience.

### 中文

- **天气格子**：新增完整功能天气格子，支持四种布局模式（迷你、紧凑、标准、详细），城市搜索（离线 `cities.json` 数据库 + Windows Location API）、自动定位、逐小时和每周预报、日出日落时间、紫外线指数、降水概率、湿度、风速、大气压、丰富皮肤背景和可配置刷新频率。标准视图在 250×215 及以上尺寸激活。逐小时温度列表支持横向滚动条和鼠标滚轮。周预报填满剩余空间，小尺寸下也可滚动。刷新时显示旋转加载动画并隐藏内容。

- **格子标题字号**：功能格子标题现在根据用户设置（`TextSize`/`IconSize`）动态计算 `TitleTextSize` 和 `TitleIconSize`，不再使用固定值。新增 `RefreshMetrics()` 方法在设置变化时更新标题度量。
- **内存泄漏修复**：`TodoWidgetViewModel` 实现 `IDisposable`，`TodoWidgetContentAdapter` 在格子销毁时正确释放 ViewModel，防止内存泄漏。
- **删除格子按钮**：所有类型格子的"更多"菜单中均可删除格子，不再限于文件格子。修复 `ContentWidgetWindow` 更多菜单弹出位置。
- **设置页扩展**：外观设置新增独立的材质类型选择（云母 / 亚克力 / 纯色）和边框样式选择（无边框 / 细 / 中）。
- **格子层级改进**：`WidgetLayerService` 新增 `SetWindowToDesktopLevel` 方法，不使用 `HWND_BOTTOM` 即可将窗口推至桌面层级，防止 Win+D 隐藏格子。
- **本地化文案精简**：精简拖拽诊断相关文案（中英文），表述更简洁明了。
- **FolderWatcherService 优化**：将基于 `CancellationTokenSource` 的防抖替换为 `DispatcherQueueTimer`，减少文件系统变更通知时的线程池任务创建。
- **代码重构 — WidgetWindowBase**：提取新的 `WidgetWindowBase.cs`（1027 行），统一窗口设置、背景管理、层级控制、拖拽/调整大小逻辑和显示器变化恢复。`ContentWidgetWindow` 和 `QuickCaptureWidgetWindow` 现在继承此共享基类，消除重复的窗口管理代码。
- **代码重构 — WidgetWindow**：将 `WidgetWindow.xaml.cs`（约 5000 行）拆分为 6 个 partial 类：`Rename`（335 行）、`Menus`（677）、`ItemSurface`（364）、`Clipboard`（249）、`Selection`（397）、`DragDrop`（806）。主文件降至 2828 行。
- **代码重构 — WidgetManager**：将 `WidgetManager.cs`（3532 行）拆分为 4 个 partial 类：`WidgetManager.TrayAnimation.cs`（353 行，托盘显示/隐藏动画）、`WidgetManager.ZOrder.cs`（376 行，层级管理/鼠标钩子）、`WidgetManager.Storage.cs`（595 行，收纳管理/文件夹映射/孤立清理）、`WidgetManager.FeatureWidgets.cs`（889 行，音乐/天气/待办/随记功能格子）。核心文件降至 1383 行。
- **日志轮转**：新增 `TryRotateLogFileIfNeeded`，基于 5MB 大小阈值自动备份到 `.bak` 并清理旧日志。
- **原子化设置写入**：`SettingsService.SaveToFileOnlyAsync` 改为先写入 `.tmp` 临时文件再移动到最终路径，防止写入中断导致配置损坏。
- **新用户引导优化**：简化引导动画 API，优化首次启动体验。

## 1.2.7 - 2026-07-09

### English

- Replaced the fixed 16ms `DispatcherQueueTimer` in widget tray animation with `CompositionTarget.Rendering`, which is driven by the system VSync. Animations now run at the native display refresh rate — 60fps on 60Hz screens, 144fps on 144Hz screens — eliminating visible stutter on high-refresh-rate displays.
- Replaced the triple `Task.Delay` backdrop refresh pattern with a single staged `DispatcherQueueTimer` (80ms → 240ms → 580ms), reducing thread-pool scheduling overhead and keeping all refresh work on the UI thread.
- Removed an empty `PointerMoved` handler from widget item surfaces and added state guards to `PointerEntered`/`PointerExited` so hover surface updates are skipped while the window is closing, animating, or hidden.
- Stopped the music widget's progress, visualizer, and transition timers when the widget is deactivated, and restarted them on activation, eliminating unnecessary CPU usage when the widget is not visible.
- Added a 200ms debounce to `UISettings.ColorValuesChanged` in `ThemeService` so system accent color and theme changes no longer trigger redundant `RefreshAppearance` calls.
- Reduced the icon cache limit from 500 to 200 entries and set `DecodePixelWidth` before `SetSourceAsync` for both icons (48px) and image thumbnails (80px), lowering memory usage from decoded bitmaps.

- 将毛玻璃背景的三次 `Task.Delay` 刷新替换为单个分阶段 `DispatcherQueueTimer`（80ms → 240ms → 580ms），减少线程池调度开销，所有刷新工作在 UI 线程定时器内完成。
- 移除格子项目表面的空 `PointerMoved` 事件处理器，并为 `PointerEntered`/`PointerExited` 增加状态守卫，窗口关闭、动画运行或隐藏时跳过无意义的悬停状态计算。
- 音乐格子失焦时停止进度、频谱和过渡定时器，激活时重新启动，消除不可见时的无效 CPU 占用。
- 为 `ThemeService` 的 `UISettings.ColorValuesChanged` 增加 200ms 防抖，系统强调色和主题变化不再触发多次冗余的 `RefreshAppearance` 调用。
- 图标缓存上限从 500 降至 200，并在 `SetSourceAsync` 之前设置 `DecodePixelWidth`（图标 48px、缩略图 80px），降低解码位图的内存占用。

## 1.1.2 - 2026-06-26

### English

- Optimized Quick Capture tab switching performance: added equality guards to item view model updates, replaced O(n²) collection diffing with dictionary-based O(n) lookup, and cached tab/item action button brushes to eliminate per-switch allocations.
- Added a new setting "Focus clicked widget only" for batch widget raise behavior. When enabled, clicking one widget hides all others; when disabled (default), all widgets stay visible together.
- Fixed Z-order inconsistency during batch raise from tray: widgets no longer fall behind fullscreen applications when clicking one widget, and the previously-clicked widget no longer stays on top unexpectedly.
- Unified Z-order behavior between file widgets and Quick Capture widgets to prevent asymmetric deactivation handling.

### 中文

### English

- Improved tray and global-hotkey behavior so file widgets and Quick Capture are raised, hidden, and restored as one group.
- Added a light WidgetManager restore path that keeps DeskBox widgets together after menu interactions and restores the group only after the user moves back to another app.
- Improved full-screen app behavior: F7 can raise widgets again when they are visible but covered, and a keyboard-hook fallback prevents apps such as Axure from consuming the configured hotkey first.
- Improved widget show/hide animation with linear timing, shorter default duration, and group-aware off-screen slide distances so adjacent widgets move out consistently.
