# DeskBox Current Architecture

Foundation overview: 2026-07-20. Maintenance entry updated: 2026-09-23.

Current implementation progress and the next bounded batch are recorded in
[architecture-optimization-progress-20260922.md](architecture-optimization-progress-20260922.md).
The original foundation sections below describe their historical milestone;
use current source and the progress record when they differ. Todo enablement
and reminder settings now have a feature editor, a settings coordinator, and
an explicitly owned reminder runtime. Settings sections are created on demand.
Search settings now use an injected editor/coordinator with per-visit request
cancellation; hiding settings releases the page visit while the global search
runtime remains owned by the application. BackupRuntime now owns scheduled and
manual backup work; ShutdownSequence drains work before consumer/container
cleanup. Backup settings now use an injected editor and coordinator; each
visible cloud page owns its credential, probe, and list requests, while uploads
remain app-owned. QuickCapture enablement and recording choices now share one
settings coordinator; a feature runtime owns the clipboard listener and drains
retired captures. Search master enablement now shares the settings coordinator;
the application still owns its global engine, hotkey, and popup instances. The
content-window ID/HWND registration now mutates WidgetManager's existing
collections through one boundary; file-widget sessions remain with their
existing dictionary but now use one identity-aware registration boundary.
SurfaceRegistry retains the previous active host while a group-promotion
candidate is prepared and rejects overlapping candidates. Member claims now
transfer only through an explicit, validated group-topology commit; merge,
detach, dissolve, and reorder wait for relevant Surface switches to settle.
Non-reuse detach and dissolve now compensate replacement creation or first-frame
failure after topology settings have been persisted; merge distinguishes failures
before and after the durable save. Reused-HWND detach now keeps memory and Surface
claims aligned with whichever topology was durably saved. Isolated Debug checks
confirmed real HWND ownership for merge, detach, dissolve, and injected detach
failures. Todo layout mode, its legacy wide-detail flag, and wide-layout auto
selection now share the Todo settings coordinator. Todo's default filter,
seven visible-tab flags, and tab-bar switch now commit together through
that coordinator. Todo preview-line count and its two optional text-size
overrides now use the same writer while retaining global-size inheritance and
the existing appearance-preview timing. Todo new-task placement and editor
Enter behavior use that writer too. Todo completed-task visibility, footer
options, and tab style now use the same writer. Todo feature-default restoration
also delegates reminder preferences to the coordinator; the settings page no
longer writes Todo fields directly. QuickCapture's default view, three visible
tabs, and tab-bar switch now commit through its settings coordinator without
refreshing the clipboard listener for navigation-only changes. QuickCapture
tab style, created-time visibility, and preview-line count now use a separate
presentation snapshot in the same coordinator. The recent-record limit and its
destructive trim are now owned by that coordinator: it coalesces queued values,
reports trim failures, and drains active work on shutdown. QuickCapture's
optional list and content text-size overrides also use that coordinator;
stored zero continues to inherit the global text size without being rewritten
as an explicit override during settings refresh.

## 2026-09-29 state snapshot

The first architecture-optimization phase closed at batch 51. The facts below
are the settled end state on top of the historical sections underneath; the
per-batch record lives in
[architecture-optimization-progress-20260922.md](architecture-optimization-progress-20260922.md)
(batches 1-51, full log).

- Settings shell. `SettingsViewModel` went from 33 partials / 11,495 lines to
  23 partials / 3,941 lines through the batch 29-50 settings-coordinator
  migration and facade retirement. All settings-page writes and binding
  surfaces are owned by the settings coordinators (13 per the batch-50
  contract; `PerformanceSettingsCoordinator` joined as the 14th in batch 50)
  and the 16 Features editor VMs. General (language / auto-start) and About
  (update card) stay on the shell by the batch-50 verdict: host-lifeline
  sections whose writers are services the Features layer must not reference.
- P/Invoke. Non-Platform declarations are a hard zero since batch 31: all 270
  declarations live under `src/DeskBox/Platform`.
- AppSettings. Re-qualified by batch 51 as a frozen on-disk wire contract:
  the 220 passthroughs are pure disk-schema mapping and cannot be deleted,
  slice-direct serialization cannot stay byte-equivalent, and runtime
  dependencies should read through slices. Growing or shrinking the facade is
  a disk schema change and requires a versioned migration.
- Widget content. Seven widget kinds are unified on `WidgetContentAdapterBase`
  (the adapter owns the view model and a lazy view; the leaf can be dropped).
  Search's cold subscription no longer materializes a tree.
- Device layer. `widget-layout.json` is the sealed home for layout state
  (batch 30 verification). `IFeatureRuntime` and `FeatureRuntimeRegistry` are
  formalized contracts (batch 32): idempotent Start/Dispose semantics,
  reverse-registration shutdown sweep, leak isolation.
- Tests and AOT gates. The full suite grew from 4,073 to 4,487 tests. The AOT
  gates are WMC1510 = 864 (zero touch), the nameof-count ratchets (shell AOT
  bridge = 33; per-editor bridges pinned by their own tests), and the
  21-scenario managed-UI smoke matrix in `scripts/run-aot-managed-ui-smoke.ps1`.

This document describes the current architecture after the 1.2.0 widget foundation work. It is intended as the short, current-state handoff for future maintenance. Historical plans and checkpoints live under the archive folders.

## Current Goal

DeskBox is moving toward a reusable widget foundation without forcing every existing widget into the same implementation immediately.

The current rule is:

- Reuse shared shell, content, animation, menu, settings, and lifecycle helpers where stable.
- Keep high-risk legacy behavior in place until it can be migrated in small steps.
- New feature widgets should use the shared content-window path unless they have a proven reason to own a dedicated host.

## Widget Types

Current widget kinds are represented by `WidgetKind`.

Current production widget categories:

- `File`: file organizer / mapped folder widgets.
- `QuickCapture`: the note and clipboard widget, now using the shared content-window path.
- `Todo`: content-type feature widget using `ContentWidgetWindow`.
- `Music`: content-type feature widget using `ContentWidgetWindow` and Windows media sessions.
- `Weather`: content-type feature widget using `ContentWidgetWindow`, Open-Meteo API, and adaptive responsive layouts.

Planned placeholder kinds:

- `Tags`
- `SystemMonitor`

Legacy value:

- `Productivity` is treated as legacy and should not be reintroduced into active creation paths.

## Main Architecture Flow

The intended content-widget path is:

```text
WidgetKind
-> WidgetRegistry
-> WidgetContentDescriptor
-> WidgetContentFactory / IWidgetContentProvider
-> IWidgetContent
-> ContentWidgetWindow
-> WidgetManager
```

Use this path for future content-type widgets whenever possible.

## Core Files

Core widget foundation:

- `src/DeskBox/Models/WidgetKind.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Models/WidgetConfig.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Services/WidgetRegistry.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Services/WidgetContentDescriptor.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Services/WidgetContentFactory.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Services/IWidgetContentProvider.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Services/ContentWidgetWindowFactory.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Services/WidgetManager.cs`

Window creation routing:

- `WidgetWindowProvider` inside `WidgetManager`: maps a creatable `WidgetKind` to the correct host-window creation path.
- Current providers: File/Todo/Music/Weather/Search -> `ContentWidgetWindow`, QuickCapture -> `QuickCaptureWidgetWindow`.
- File widgets use `FileSurfaceContent` inside the unified content host. The legacy `WidgetWindow` host has been removed.

Shared shell and window helpers:

- `src/DeskBox/Controls/WidgetShell.xaml`
- `src/DeskBox/Controls/WidgetShell.xaml.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Controls/WidgetShellContentHost.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Services/WidgetTrayAnimationController.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Services/WidgetTitleBarMetrics.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Services/WidgetSessionManager.cs`

Current windows:

- `src/DeskBox/Views/QuickCaptureWidgetWindow.xaml.cs`: QuickCapture / note widget.
- `src/DeskBox/Views/ContentWidgetWindow.xaml.cs`: File, Todo, Music, Weather, Search, and future content widgets.

Current Todo implementation:

- `src/DeskBox/Controls/WidgetContents/TodoWidgetContent.xaml`
- `src/DeskBox/Controls/WidgetContents/TodoWidgetContent.xaml.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Controls/WidgetContents/TodoWidgetContentAdapter.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/ViewModels/TodoWidgetViewModel.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Services/TodoWidgetStore.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Services/TodoWidgetContentProvider.cs`

Current Music implementation:

- `src/DeskBox/Controls/WidgetContents/MusicWidgetContent.xaml`
- `src/DeskBox/Controls/WidgetContents/MusicWidgetContent.xaml.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Controls/WidgetContents/MusicWidgetContentAdapter.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/ViewModels/MusicWidgetViewModel.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/ViewModels/MusicBarViewModel.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Services/MusicSessionService.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Services/MusicVolumeService.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Services/MusicWidgetContentProvider.cs`

Current Weather implementation:

- `src/DeskBox/Controls/WidgetContents/WeatherWidgetContent.xaml`
- `src/DeskBox/Controls/WidgetContents/WeatherWidgetContent.xaml.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Controls/WidgetContents/WeatherWidgetContentAdapter.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/ViewModels/WeatherWidgetViewModel.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/ViewModels/WeatherWidgetViewModel.DataProcessing.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/ViewModels/WeatherWidgetViewModel.RefreshAndLayout.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Services/WeatherService.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Helpers/WeatherCodeMapper.cs`
- `src/DeskBox/Helpers/WindowsLocationHelper.cs`

## WidgetRegistry

`WidgetRegistry` answers whether a kind is known, implemented, creatable, and available in the current session.

Current behavior:

- `File`, `QuickCapture`, `Todo`, `Music`, and `Weather` are creatable/implemented.
- `Tags` and `SystemMonitor` are known but not user-creatable.
- Feature widget availability is checked through `FeatureWidgetSettings`.

Do not use ad hoc `if` checks in new UI entry points when `WidgetRegistry` can answer the question.

## Descriptors

`WidgetContentDescriptor` stores content metadata:

- default title
- glyph
- implementation stage
- availability
- create-entry visibility
- localization keys
- optional settings page metadata

`WidgetContentFactory.GetDescriptors()` and `GetCreateEntryDescriptors()` are the preferred sources for create-entry and future "more widgets" UI.

Current descriptor entry points:

- `GetDescriptors()`: all active non-legacy content descriptors.
- `GetCreateEntryDescriptors()`: user-facing create menu entries, currently only file widgets.
- `GetFeatureWidgetEntryDescriptors()`: Settings > Feature widgets / More widgets entries, including available and planned feature widgets.

## Content Providers

`WidgetContentFactory` now uses provider registration for detached content creation.

Current providers:

- `TodoWidgetContentProvider`: creates real Todo content.
- `MusicWidgetContentProvider`: creates real Music content.
- `WeatherWidgetContentProvider`: creates real Weather content.
- `PlaceholderWidgetContentProvider`: creates placeholder content for planned kinds.

Current contract:

- `IWidgetContentProvider` owns content creation for one kind.
- `WidgetContentProviderContext` passes shared services and factory helpers.
- `ContentWidgetWindowFactory` asks `WidgetContentFactory.CreateDetachedContent(...)` for content and does not special-case Todo.

Future content widgets should add a provider instead of expanding a switch in `WidgetContentFactory`.

## Windows

### File Widgets

File widgets use `FileSurfaceContent` hosted by `ContentWidgetWindow`. The old
file-only `WidgetWindow` visual tree and interaction implementation have been
removed.

The shared file surface owns the high-risk behaviors:

- external drag/drop
- internal drag sorting
- shortcut handling
- rename and IME handling
- file operations
- mapped-folder behavior
- right-click menus

The detailed drag/stack protocol, operation semantics, regression matrix, and
known failure modes are documented in
[`file_drag_stack_contract.md`](file_drag_stack_contract.md). Treat its
internal-arrangement versus filesystem-transfer boundary as a release contract.

Current shared pieces used by file widgets:

- `WidgetShell` hosts the outer shell.
- `WidgetShellContentHost` owns content switching and disposal.
- `FileItemSurface` owns icon/list item presentation.
- `WidgetTitleBarMetrics` controls title/button visual sizing.
- `WidgetTrayAnimationController` controls tray/F7 animation execution.
- shared menu font and spacing resources from `App.xaml`.

### QuickCapture

QuickCapture still uses `QuickCaptureWidgetWindow`.

This is intentional because it has special behavior:

- clipboard monitoring
- note input
- tabs for records/pinned/recent
- image/text/file capture
- QuickCapture-specific menus and editing behavior

Current shared pieces used by QuickCapture:

- `WidgetShell`
- `WidgetTitleBarMetrics`
- `WidgetTrayAnimationController`
- shared menu resources

### ContentWidgetWindow

`ContentWidgetWindow` is the host for content-type feature widgets.

Current production users:

- File
- Todo
- Music
- Weather
- Search

Future likely users:

- SystemMonitor
- Tags, if it is implemented as a content widget

Content widgets should prefer this host instead of adding a new dedicated window.

## WidgetShell

`WidgetShell` is the reusable shell for title bar, background, divider, hover buttons, and content slot.

Current capabilities:

- `ShellContent`
- `TitleGlyph`
- `TitleBarContent` for transitional custom title bars
- `ShowHoverButtons`
- `ShowAddButton`
- `IsTitleEditable`
- `TitleEditorContent`
- `AddRequested`
- `MoreRequested`
- `CloseRequested`
- title pointer and right-click events

Current policy:

- New simple content widgets should use the default shell title bar.
- File-specific title editing and drag behavior stay in `FileSurfaceContent`; the top-level host remains generic.
- Avoid adding widget-specific visual hacks inside `WidgetShell`.

## Title Bar Metrics

`WidgetTitleBarMetricsCalculator` centralizes title bar visual sizing.

It controls:

- title icon size
- title text size
- action button size
- action icon size
- row height
- transitional inner title padding

Current users:

- `QuickCaptureWidgetWindow`
- `ContentWidgetWindow`

File widgets intentionally use zero inner title padding to avoid double padding with `WidgetShell`. QuickCapture keeps inner padding because its current title layout uses it as part of the custom title content.

## Animation

`WidgetTrayAnimationController` centralizes tray/F7 animation execution.

It controls:

- animation profile creation
- window offset movement
- opacity
- scale
- timer progression
- easing
- generation checks
- restoration of visual/window state
- offset override for grouped tray animation

Current users:

- `QuickCaptureWidgetWindow`
- `ContentWidgetWindow`

The controller only owns animation mechanics. Host windows still own:

- layer behavior
- backdrop suppression/restoration
- whether hide means close or only hide
- feature switch synchronization
- file item transition restoration

Do not move business semantics into the animation controller.

## Feature Widget Settings

`FeatureWidgetSettings` is the compatibility layer for singleton feature widget enabled states.

Current feature kinds:

- `QuickCapture`
- `Todo`
- `Music`
- `Weather`

Settings are stored in:

- generic `FeatureWidgetEnabledStates`
- legacy mirrored fields: `QuickCaptureEnabled`, `TodoEnabled`

The legacy fields are kept for compatibility. Do not add new standalone fields such as `WeatherEnabled`, `TagsEnabled`, or `SystemMonitorEnabled`; use the feature state bag instead.

## WidgetManager

`WidgetManager` owns lifecycle, restoration, F7/tray coordination, z-order, widget creation, deletion, and settings synchronization.

Current feature widget dispatch:

- `FeatureWidgetHandler` maps a feature kind to create/show, enable/disable, and hide-loaded behavior.
- `CreateOrShowFeatureWidgetAsync(...)` uses the handler registry.
- `SetFeatureWidgetEnabledAsync(...)` uses the handler registry.
- `WidgetWindowProvider` maps creatable widget kinds to host-window creation paths.
- `CreateRegisteredWidgetFromConfigAsync(...)` uses the window provider registry instead of a `WidgetKind` switch.

Current handlers:

- QuickCapture: dedicated window path.
- Todo: content window path.
- Music: content window path.
- Weather: content window path.

Still intentionally present:

- `CreateWidgetOfKindAsync(...)` still has creation-specific behavior for File and Todo.
- `ShowWidgetAsync(...)` and tray batch preparation still have host-specific existing-window handling because each host stores loaded windows in different collections and has different reveal behavior.

Do not force loaded-window lookup, reveal semantics, or file-widget business behavior into a generic provider until the host boundaries are clearer.

## Settings UI

Current state:

- The feature widget list is generated from `SettingsViewModel.FeatureWidgetEntries`.
- Feature entries are derived from `WidgetContentFactory.GetFeatureWidgetEntryDescriptors()`.
- Available feature widgets, such as QuickCapture, Todo, Music, and Weather, show toggles.
- Planned feature widgets, such as Tags and SystemMonitor, are shown as descriptor-driven read-only rows with status text instead of disabled hand-written UI.
- Toggle state flows through `FeatureWidgetSettings` and `WidgetManager.SetFeatureWidgetEnabledAsync(...)`.

Global appearance settings should contain settings shared by all widgets:

- default width
- default height
- background opacity
- text size
- show hover buttons
- animation effect
- animation speed
- theme/material/corner settings

File-widget display settings should contain only file-widget display details:

- icon size
- horizontal spacing
- vertical spacing
- file name width
- extension display
- list details

Do not place Todo, QuickCapture, Music, Weather, Tags, or SystemMonitor business settings inside file-widget display settings.

## Menus

Menu font and spacing are centralized in `App.xaml`.

Relevant resources include:

- `DeskBoxMenuFontFamily`
- `DeskBoxMenuPresenterPadding`
- `DeskBoxMenuItemPadding`
- `DeskBoxMenuItemMinHeight`
- `DeskBoxMenuItemFontSize`

Tray menu, widget title menus, and content menus should use these shared resources. Do not hard-code local menu font or padding unless there is a specific WinUI limitation.

## Data Storage

Main settings:

- `%LocalAppData%/DeskBox/settings.json`

Widget-specific data:

- `%LocalAppData%/DeskBox/data/widgets/{widgetId}/...`

Todo data:

- `%LocalAppData%/DeskBox/data/widgets/{widgetId}/todo.json`

QuickCapture data:

- `%LocalAppData%/DeskBox/data/quick-capture/quick-capture.json`
- `%LocalAppData%/DeskBox/data/quick-capture/images/...`
- `%LocalAppData%/DeskBox/data/quick-capture/thumbnails/...`

Uninstalling the app may remove binaries but should not be assumed to remove `%LocalAppData%/DeskBox`. This is user data.

## Adding A New Content Widget

Recommended sequence:

1. Confirm `WidgetKind`.
2. Add or update `WidgetContentDescriptor`.
3. Keep `WidgetRegistry` as not creatable until content, storage, and tests are ready.
4. Implement `XxxWidgetContent`.
5. Implement `XxxWidgetViewModel`.
6. Implement `XxxWidgetStore` if persistence is needed.
7. Implement `IWidgetContent` adapter if the view does not directly implement it.
8. Add `XxxWidgetContentProvider`.
9. Register provider in `WidgetContentFactory`.
10. Add localization keys.
11. Add a `WidgetWindowProvider` registration in `WidgetManager` only when the kind is ready to create a real window.
12. Add tests for descriptor, provider, store, view model, settings entry, and registry coverage.
13. Only then make the kind available/creatable in `WidgetRegistry`.
14. Manually test F7, tray, close, delete, restart restore, theme, opacity, text size, and settings sync.

## Suggested Feature Order

Lowest-risk next feature widget after 1.3.0:

- `SystemMonitor` with CPU, memory, and network only.

Reasons:

- no location permission
- no account or external API
- no file index complexity
- good test for realtime refresh content widgets

Then:

- `Tags`: internal DeskBox index only, no file metadata writes.

Last:

- widget merging, because it changes window/data/drag/tab behavior and should have a separate design document.

## High-Risk Areas

Be careful with these areas:

- Win10/Win11 drag and drop.
- UAC / integrity level drag behavior.
- file rename IME behavior.
- Esc cancel rename.
- F7/tray z-order restore.
- settings window topmost behavior.
- tray/menu font fallback on Windows.
- file shortcut `.lnk` drag sorting.
- installer data retention and install path migration.

Touch these only with focused changes and manual regression.

## Current Verification

Most recent verification:

```powershell
dotnet build .\DeskBox.sln -c Debug -p:Platform=x64 --no-restore
dotnet test .\DeskBox.sln -c Debug -p:Platform=x64 --no-build
```

Result:

```text
187/187 passed
```

## Manual Regression Checklist

After changes to Shell, windows, manager, settings, or menus, test at least:

- App starts and restores File, QuickCapture, Todo, Music, and Weather widgets.
- Music widget restores, reads Windows media session state, and keeps system volume control usable.
- Weather widget restores, fetches location data, and displays current/forecast correctly.
- F7 shows/hides all expected widgets.
- Tray left-click behavior is correct.
- Tray right-click menu font is correct.
- Widget title/content right-click menu font is correct.
- Clicking another app restores widgets to desktop layer.
- Settings window is not covered by widgets.
- Feature widget toggles sync with desktop deletion/close.
- File widget external drag-in works.
- File widget internal sorting works.
- `.lnk` files can be dragged and sorted.
- File rename supports Chinese IME.
- Esc cancels rename.
- QuickCapture recent list scrolls.
- Clipboard recording setting persists after restart.
- Theme, opacity, text size, hover buttons, and animation settings apply to all widget families.

## Maintenance Rules

- Prefer WinUI / Windows native controls.
- Prefer `WidgetShell` for title and action surfaces.
- Prefer `ContentWidgetWindow` for new content widgets.
- Prefer descriptors and providers over scattered switches.
- Keep legacy compatibility fields until migration is proven safe.
- Make local backups before structural changes.
- Keep changes narrow around drag/drop, IME, F7/z-order, installer, and data migration.
